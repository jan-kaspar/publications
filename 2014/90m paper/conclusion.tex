\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
%
Thanks to a very-high statistics data set TOTEM has excluded a purely exponential differential 
cross-section for elastic proton-proton scattering with significance greater than $7\,\sigma$
in the $|t|$ range from 0.027 to 0.2\,GeV$^{2}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8\,$TeV. The data
are described satisfactorily with an exponent linear or quadratic in $t$.
Using this refined parameterisation for the extrapolation to the optical point,
$t = 0$, yields a total cross-section compatible with the previous measurement.

\todo{soften, the other paper will come later}
In the next article~\cite{1km}, this proof of non-exponentiality in a 
$t$-domain strongly
dominated by hadronic interactions will be combined with a measurement of 
elastic scattering in the Coulomb-nuclear interference region, providing strong
constraints on the phenomenological description of the hadronic phase and of 
the interference mechanism.
