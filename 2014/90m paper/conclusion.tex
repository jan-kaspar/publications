\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%
Thanks to a very-high statistics data set TOTEM has excluded a purely exponential differential 
cross-section for elastic proton-proton scattering with significance greater than $7\,\sigma$
in the $|t|$ range from 0.027 to 0.2\,GeV$^{2}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8\,$TeV. The data
are described satisfactorily with an exponent quadratic or cubic in $t$.
Using this refined parametrisation for the extrapolation to the optical point,
$t = 0$, yields total cross-section values compatible with the previous measurement, in all cases
neglecting the effects due to the Coulomb interaction.

In an upcoming analysis, this proof of non-exponentiality in a 
$t$-domain strongly dominated by hadronic interactions will be combined with a measurement of 
elastic scattering in the Coulomb-nuclear interference region,
thus allowing to study the role of the Coulomb interaction in the non-exponential behaviour.
