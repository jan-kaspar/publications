The presented measurement is based on data taken in July 2012, during the LHC fill number 2836, where the vertical
RPs were inserted at $9.5\,\sigma_{\rm beam}$. Two (in the beginning) or three (later) bunches were used, with
a typical population of $8\cdot10^{10}$ protons, yielding instantaneous luminosity of about $10^{28}\un{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ per bunch. The special
$\beta^* = 90\un{m}$ optics was used... TODO: some description or reference. The main trigger required coincidence between RPs in both arms,
however combining the near and far units of a station in OR for safe efficiency. In the about $11\un{h}$ long
data-taking, a luminosity of $735\un{\mu b^{-1}}$ was accumulated, giving
$7.2\cdot 10^6$ tagged elastic events.
