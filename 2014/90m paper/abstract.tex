The TOTEM experiment has made a precise measurement of the elastic 
proton-proton differential cross-section at the centre-of-mass energy 
$\sqrt s = 8\un{TeV}$ based on a high-statistics data sample obtained with 
the $\beta^* = 90\un{m}$ optics. 
Both the statistical and systematic uncertainties remain below $1\un{\%}$, except for the $t$-independent contribution from the overall normalisation. This unprecedented precision allows to exclude a purely exponential differential cross-section in the range of four-momentum transfer squared $0.027 < |t| < 0.2\un{GeV^2}$ with a significance greater than $7\un{\sigma}$. Two extended parametrisations, with quadratic and cubic polynomials in the exponent, are shown to be well compatible with the data. Using them for the differential cross-section extrapolation to $t=0$, and further applying the optical theorem, yields total cross-section estimates of $(100.8 \pm 2.1)\un{mb}$ and $(101.2 \pm 2.1)\un{mb}$, respectively, in agreement with previous TOTEM measurements.
