The final differential cross-section in the ``optimised'' binning is presented in Table~\ref{tab:data} and Figure \ref{fig:data ob}. In order to visualise small deviations from the leading pure-exponential behaviour, Figure~\ref{fig:data rel ob} shows the relative difference of the cross-section from a reference exponential. This plot immediately suggests a non-exponentiality of the data: pure exponentials would look like (almost) linear functions in this reference frame.

To study the detailed behaviour of the differential cross-section, a series of fits has been made using the parametrisation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fit param}
{\d\sigma\over\d t}(t) = \left. \d\sigma\over\d t\right|_{0} \ \exp\left( \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N_{b}} b_i\, t^i \right) \ ,
\end{equation}
which includes the pure exponential ($N_b = 1$) and its straight-forward extensions ($N_b = 2, 3$).

The fits have been performed by the standard least-squares method, in particular minimising:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi sq}
	\chi^2 = \Delta^\T \mat V^{-1} \Delta\ ,\qquad
	\Delta = (\hbox{data} - \hbox{fit})\ ,\qquad
	\mat V = \mat V_{\rm stat} + \mat V_{\rm syst}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta$ is a vector of differences between the differential cross-section data and a fit function evaluated at the bin representative points (see Table~\ref{tab:data}). The covariance matrix $\mat V$ is given by the sum of the statistical component $\mat V_{\rm stat}$ (statistical uncertainty from Table~\ref{tab:data} on the diagonal) and the systematic component $\mat V_{\rm syst}$ (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:covar mat})).

The quality of fits is judged on the basis of several measures. The first is the value of $\chi^2$ after minimisation divided by the number of degrees of freedom (ndf). Secondly, the p-value stands for the probability that a $\chi^2$ value greater than the observed one would be drawn from the $\chi^2$ distribution with the given number of degrees of freedom. Finally, significance means the half-width of a central region that needs to be excluded from a normal distribution to get the same integrated probability as the p-value. The significance is expressed in multiples of sigma, the standard deviation of the normal distribution.

Figure~\ref{fig:data rel ob} shows several fits of the differential cross-section with the parametrisation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:fit param}) and different numbers of parameters in the exponent, $N_b$. The corresponding fit quality is given in Table~\ref{tab:fits ob}, indicating that the purely exponential fit ($N_b = 1$) is excluded at $7.2\un{\sigma}$ significance.
%
The other two fits ($N_b = 2, 3$) are of reasonable quality and can, therefore, be used for a total cross-section estimation with the optical theorem in the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:si tot}
\sigma_{\rm tot}^2 = {16\pi\, (\hbar c)^2\over 1 + \rho^2}\, \left. \d\sigma_{\rm el}\over\d t\right|_0\ ,
\end{equation}
which neglects the effects due to the Coulomb interaction (QED).
Using the COMPETE~\cite{compete} preferred-model extrapolation of $\rho = 0.140\pm 0.007$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:si tot results}
	\begin{aligned}
		N_b &= 2:\quad \sigma_{\rm tot} = (100.8 \pm 2.1)\un{mb}\ ,\\	% A = 529.3 +- 21.9
		N_b &= 3:\quad \sigma_{\rm tot} = (101.2 \pm 2.1)\un{mb}\ ,\\	% A = 533.5 +- 21.9
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which are well compatible with the previous measurement using the luminosity-independent \linebreak method~\cite{prl111}.
%for the first time using a non-exponential extrapolation to $t=0$.

Differential cross-section using the ``optimised'' binning and plotted as relative difference from a reference exponential (see vertical axis). The black dots represent data points with statistical uncertainty bars. The coloured lines correspond to fits with parametrisation Eq.~(\ref{eq:fit param}) and different numbers of parameters in the exponent. The red line lies seemingly too high with respect to the data points, which is a consequence of the systematic degrees of freedom included in the fit (some of the effects in Figure~\ref{fig:syst unc} may flatten the distribution which at the same time changes the overall normalisation). The yellow band corresponds to the full systematic uncertainty, the brown-hatched one includes all systematic contributions except the normalisation. Both bands are centred around the fit curve with $N_b = 3$.

% results from per-mille binning

The incompatibility between a pure-exponential behaviour and the data with the ``per-mille'' binning can be shown equally well. However, since the number of points is drastically increased, the straight-forward $\chi^2$ test does not have sufficient sensitivity, and a different test is used. Assuming that the data can be described by a pure exponential, the fit parameters should have compatible values for fits over different ranges. Figure~\ref{fig:data rel cpb0.001} shows a fit (minimisation of $\chi^2$ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi sq})) with the parametrisation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:split fit param}
{\d\sigma\over\d t}(t) =
\begin{cases}
a_1\, \e^{b_1 |t|} & |t| < 0.07\un{GeV^2}\\
a_2\, \e^{b_2 |t|} & |t| > 0.07\un{GeV^2}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
giving a reasonable fit quality (p-value of 0.57). The compatibility of the parameters in the two $|t|$ regions can be verified by evaluating
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi sq param}
\chi_p^2 = \Delta_p^\T \mat V_p^{-1} \Delta_p\ ,\quad \Delta_p =
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 - a_2\\
b_1 - b_2\\
\end{pmatrix}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\mat V_p$ is the covariance matrix for the difference vector $\Delta_p$. It yields $\chi_p^2 = 65.4$ which with $2$ degrees of freedom corresponds to a p-value of $6.2\cdot10^{-15}$ and a significance of $7.8\un{\sigma}$. This, in turn, rules out the hypothesis of a purely exponential behaviour of the data over the entire observed range.

Since parameters estimated with the least squares method are unbiased, the test in Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi sq param}) is asymptotically binning independent. Indeed, applying it to the data in the ``optimised'' binning (prior to the statistical uncertainty rescaling, Section \ref{sec:stat unc adj}) yields $\chi^2_p = 65.7$ which corresponds to a significance of $7.8\un{\sigma}$. After the uncertainty rescaling, the exclusion significance increases to $9.0\un{\sigma}$.
