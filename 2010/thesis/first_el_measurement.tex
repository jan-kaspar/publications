\chapter[felm]{The first elastic scattering measurement at the LHC}

\> attach paper
\> comment on what I have done (mostly with Simone)

\section{Alignment}

\> alignment (previous chapter + th y matching)

\section{Background}

\> what bckg do we expect - low lumi runs
\>> mainly: DPE
\>> much less: twice a process (SD, beam gas, ...)

\> table of cuts
\>> quantities compared, cut quantity, sigma

\> all cuts applied at $3\si$ perfect efficiency, purity study is the background study

\> two parts:
\>> integral = the number of non-elastic events has passed our selection
\>> distribution = what is the distribution of such events in $t$ (= elastic definition)

INTEGRAL

\> release one of the 6 cuts, look at the tails

\> 2D example, "theorem", provided one can extract the bckg dist from the tails

\> look at \Fg{felm background dist txty} left, the backround "seems" Guassian, reasonable fit
\> every cut different rejection power, the best is cut 1, $th_x$
\> the right plot has non-negligible bckg just on one side, fit doubtful

\> compared (reasonable) fits for all 6 cuts (double-Gauss fit + tail only methods), result:
$N_{\rm b}/N_{\rm t} = (8\pm 1)\percent$ for both diagonals (t = total = signal + bckg)

DISTRIBUTION

\> looking for left-right uncorrelated background -- cannot do much more
\>> hence t left and right indep: $h(x, y) = h(x) h(y)$

\> triggered on a proton on each side
\>> but when looking on the left proton, the influence of the right one goes just to the normaliz.

\> acceptance: need to cut of the events close to $t_y$ limit

\> 2D dist: looks like exponential decrease in $t = t_x + t_y$
\>> naively expected for DPE

\> $t_x$ dist, in fact it looks more like exp/sqrt(x)
\>> much better chi sq
\>> in fact, for $h(t) \sim \exp(-b t)$

$$h(t_x, t_y) \sim {\e^{-b t_x}\over \sqrt{t_x}} {\e^{-b t_y}\over \sqrt{t_y}}$$

\>> let's try this param. but keep the b's indep. for x and y -- in fact, $t_x$ is reconstr. as for elastics, doesn't take into account xi, this would modify the x (or $t_x$) dist

\> linear fit in the triangle (empty bins are not useful)

\> fit results: bx and by difference, but consistent values for L and R and both diagonals
\>> take the mean
\>> STD DEV compatible with the estimated uncertainty

\> now, if we know $h(t_x, t_y)$, what would be the distribution of the events passing our selection?
\>> distribution in what:

$$\bar t(\ldots)
= p^2 \left( \th_x^{\rm L} + \th_x^{\rm R} \over 2 \right) + p^2 \left( \th_y^{\rm L} + \th_y^{\rm R} \over 2 \right)
= \left( \sqrt{t_x^{\rm L}} + \sqrt{t_x^{\rm R}}\over 2 \right)^2 + \left( \sqrt{t_y^{\rm L}} + \sqrt{t_y^{\rm R}}\over 2 \right)^2 $$

$$h(t) = \int $$

\> MC simulation with realistic values + fit (alternation within the estim uncertainties give the errors of the fit params)
\>> fit param.

RESULT

\> apply the normalization to the dist

\> acceptance: dist. treatment contains naturally acceptance correction (extending the param into the inaccesible region)
\>> hope that the 8 percent would survive the acceptance corrections

\> the normalization condition

\> comparison to data
