\chapter[ttm]{The TOTEM experiment}

% Approach: why, what, how

\TODO{Briefly repeat the motivation from the introduction: The forward hadronic physics is one of the least explored and understood areas of the particle physics.}

The TOTEM experiment \bref{totem04,totem08,totem10} is dedicated to measurement of forward hadronic phenomena at the LHC. The tree pillars of its physics programme are:
\> elastic scattering measurement in a wide $t$-range,
\> total cross-section measurement and
\> a study of soft and hard diffraction.


We have discussed theoretical/phenomenological description of the elastic scattering in \Sc{el}. Looking at the model predictions in \Fg{el mod dsdt large}, one can see differences of several orders of magnitude. TOTEM plans to measure the differential cross-section in the $|t|$-range from about $10^{-3}\un{GeV^2}$ (the domain of Coulomb-hadronic interference) to more than $10\un{GeV^2}$. This large coverage can be achieved by exploiting several running scenarios -- see the end of \Sc{rp measurement}. \TODO{decisive measurement}

As much as the model predictions differ for the elastic cross-section, they differ for the total-cross section. From Tb.~2 in \bref{kklp11} one can read a variation between $95$ and $110\un{mb}$. Extrapolations from lower energy measurements, see \Fg{sigma tot}, yield even higher uncertainty: from about $85\un{mb}$ to $120\un{mb}$. TOTEM plans to measure the total cross-section with the luminosity independent method, see \Sc{ttm tcs} for details. This method takes as an input the elastic and inelastic event rates and thus is closely related to the other two points of the physics programme. TOTEM aims at the final precision about $1\percent$, which would provide a decisive answer to many total-cross-related hypothesis.

\Fg{ttm processes} shows typical event topologies for certain diffractive-process classes that TOTEM plans to measure. Looking at the cross-section estimates, one can see that these processes form a large part of the total cross-section. A characteristic property of these processes is the presence of scattering products at very forward directions. Using the definition of pseudorapidity
\eqref{\et = - \log \tan {\th\over 2}}{pseudorapidity}
the one can say the presence of products at high pseudorapidity regions. \TODO{...}

For each class there are two types of diagrams (using the same color code). Left: a Feynman-like diagram showing the nature of the process, with Pomeron exchange (the double lines) as an effective description of the diffraction phenomena. Single external lines denote protons, the tripled outgoing lines represent proton dissociation. Right: a sample hit map in the pseudorapidity ($\et$) vs.~azimuthal angle ($\ph$) space.}


\> why about detectors:

TOTEM's physics programme thus sets special requirements for the detector apparatus. In particular large rapidity coverage - to detect most fragments from inelastic collisions and excellent acceptance for outgoing elastic and diffractive protons. To accomplish this task, TOTEM comprises three sub-detectors: the telescopes T1 and T2 to detect products of inelastic collisions and a system of Roman Pots (RP) for surviving proton detection.

Telescopes -- inelastic trigger, vertex reconstruction (background rejection), high radiation

All detectors are trigger capable -- important for 

RP motivation: very small angles -- need move close to the beam and detectors far from the IP, instable beams in the beginning, must be movable

\section[ttm det]{Detector apparatus}

\> how about detectors:

\Fg{ttm det overview} shows an overview of the detector apparatus of TOTEM. All detectors are placed symmetrically about IP5 (which is shared with the CMS experiment). All detectors are trigger capable.

\fig{fig/pdf/ttm_det_overview.pdf}{ttm det overview}{An overview of the TOTEM detectors. All detectors are installed symmetrically left (sector 45) and right (sector 56) of the interaction point 5 (IP5). Only the \rhs~is shown in the figure. Bottom part: the structure of the LHC around IP5. The vertical boxes represent quadrupole (Q) and dipole (D) magnets. D1 is the separation magnet -- splitting each beam to its proper beam-line, see the \rhs~of the figure. The RP stations at $147$ and $220\un{m}$ are shown by red dots (each dot represents a unit).

}

\caption{Telescopes T1}

The T1 telescopes are installed inside the CMS end-caps, they extend in the forward areas from $7.5$ to $10.5\un{m}$ on both sides of the interaction point. They cover pseudorapidity regions $3.1 < \et < 4.7$.

There is one telescope on each side of IP5 (see \Fg{t1 installed}). Each telescope consists of two quarters (see \Fg{t1 quarter}). Each quarter is formed by 5 planes equally spaced in $z$ (along the beam pipe). Each plane includes 3 trapezoidal Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) detectors, each covering about $60^\circ$ in azimuth. There is $3^\circ$ rotation and overlap between adjacent planes.

\fig[,5cm]{fig/external/t1_quarter.jpg}{t1 quarter}{[6.6cm]A T1 quarter contains 5 planes, each of them consist of 3 CSC detectors.}
\emfig

The CSC detectors are gaseous detectors (multi-wire proportional chambers) with both cathode plates segmented into strips. These strips and the anode wires are oriented at $60^\circ$ with respect to each other. Thus there are 3 read-out coordinates, which enables reconstruction of events with several 
tracks. The cathode strips are $4.5\un{mm}$ wide and placed with $5\un{mm}$ pitch. The anode wires, used for triggering, have a diameter of $30\un{\mu m}$ and are installed with $3\un{mm}$ pitch. The gas gap is as wide as $10\un{mm}$ filled with $\rm Ar/CO_2/CF_4$ mixture. The size of the detectors is growing with increasing distance from the IP, reaching the maximum of $\approx 1\un{m} \times 0.68\un{m}$. The spatial resolution of one CSC detector is about $1\un{mm}$. For further details we refer the reader to Sc.~5.2 in \bref{totem08}.



\caption{Telescopes T2}

The T2 telescopes are installed in the forward shielding of CMS between the vacuum chamber and the inner shielding of the CMS HF calorimeter, they are centered about $13.5\un{m}$ from the interaction point. The T2 telescopes cover the pseudorapidity region $5.3 < \et < 6.5$.

There is one telescope on each side of IP5, see \Fg{t2 installed}. Each telescope consists of two quarters as shown in \Fg{t2 quarter}. Each quarter includes 5 semicircular planes, each equipped with 2 back-to-back mounted Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors. Each detector has an azimuthal coverage of $192^\circ$, therefore there is an overlap between the two quarters within each telescope.

The GEM detectors are gaseous detectors where the electron multiplication is realized by three perforated Cu-clad polyimide foils, separated by $2\un{mm}$. The inner radius of the perforation holes is $65\un{\mu m}$, their density lies between $50$ and $100/\un{mm^2}$ \TODO{check}. With an electric field about $3.6 \un{kV/cm}$ between the GEM foils, the overall gas overall amplification is roughly $8000$. The GEM detectors have double read-out: strips (radial coordinate) and pads (coarse radial and azimuthal). The strip radia range from $43$ to $144\un{mm}$, their width and spacing is $80$ and $400\un{\mu m}$ respectively. The pads, used for triggering, are of sizes from $2\times 2\un{mm^2}$ to $7\times 7\un{mm^2}$. The spatial resolution is about $0.15\un{mm}$ in the radial direction and $0.8^\circ$ in the azimuthal one. Further details can be found in Sc.~5.3 in \bref{totem08}.

\section[rp measurement]{Proton Measurement with Roman Pot detectors}

\fig{fig/pdf/ttm_proton_transport.pdf}{ttm proton transport}{A scheme of the proton transport from the interaction point to a RP station. $y_{\rm N}$ and $y_{\rm F}$ are the hit points in the near and far units of the station.}


Imagine a collision which takes place at a \em{vertex}
\eqref{(x^*, y^*, s^*)^\T}{ttm ip vertex}
and where a proton is emitted, as sketched in \Fg{ttm proton transport}. One may relate the momentum $p$ of the outgoing proton to the nominal beam momentum
\eqref{p^* = p_{\rm nom} (1 - \xi^*)\ ,}{ttm xi}
where $\xi^*$ is the \em{momentum loss}. The direction of the proton is described by the \em{scattering angle} $\th^*$ and the \em{azimuthal angle} $\ph^*$:
\eqref{\vec p^* = p^* \pmatrix{\sin\th^* \cos\ph^*\cr \sin\th^*\sin\ph^* \cr \cos\th^*}
%=  p \pmatrix{\th_x\cr \th_y\cr \sqrt{1 - \th_x^2 - \th_y^2}}
\ .}{ttm mom comp}
The coordinate system $(x, y, s)$ is illustrated in \Fg{ttm proton transport}, the $s$ axis represents the beam axis.

The protons of our interest are scattered to low angles and therefore stay close to the outgoing beam and they enter the LHC magnet lattice. When the outgoing proton reaches the region of a RP station, it has momentum $p$, direction described by angles $\th$ and $\ph$ and may hit the detectors at points $y_{\rm N}$ and $y_{\rm F}$ just as shown in \Fg{ttm proton transport}.

We will use the notation that quantities related to the IP will be denoted with a star superscript, those without will be related to RP stations. The energy of the protons is conserved during the LHC transport from the IP to RP stations, therefore $p = p^*$ and $\xi = \si^*$. Thus we will not make distinction between their IP and RP values.

It will be useful to define the \em{projections of the scattering angle} (both for IP and RP-station quantities)
\eqref{\th_x = \th \cos\ph\ ,\qquad \th_y = \th \sin\ph\ .}{ttm th x y}
Similarly, one can define the projections of the momentum transfer $t$:
\eqref{t_x = t \cos^2\ph^*\ ,\qquad t_y = t \sin^2\ph^*\ ,}{ttm t x y}
This definition follows, in fact, from the low-scattering-angle approximation in \Eq{el t}, which we will commonly use in what follows (the scattering angles of interest are at most of the order $10^{-3}\un{rad}$, see e.g. \Fg{el mod dsdt large}). The definitions \Eq{ttm th x y,ttm t x y} yield relations
\eqref{t = t_x + t_y = - p^2 \th^{*2} = - p^2 (\th_x^{*2} + \th_y^{*2})\ .}{ttm t th}

Since the magnetic field within the RP stations is negligible, protons follow a straight trajectory there. The relation between RP sensor measurements and the parameters of the trajectory is therefore simple (for details see \Sc{al psi}). What is much more interesting is the proton transport from the IP to the RP stations. We will discuss it in the rest of this section.

The transverse motion of protons in the LHC can be described by a solution of the Hill's equation (see e.g.~Sc.~3.3 in \bref{wilson} or Ch.~4 in \bref{dolezal}):
\eqref{x(s) = \sqrt{\be(s) \ep}\ \cos\big(\phi(s) + \phi_0\big)\ .}{ttm hill sol}
We have written the solution for the horizontal direction only, for the vertical it is analogous. The solution has a form of oscillations with the amplitude given by the emittance $\ep$ (a measure of the beam size and divergence\footnote{%
A quantity which is used more often is the normalized emittance $\ep_{\rm N} = \be\ga \ep$. $\be$ and $\ga$ are the relativistic factors, see \Eq{sm lorentz}. The advantage of the normalized emittance is that it does not change during beam acceleration, see Sc.~4.1 in~\bref{wilson}.
}) and the $\be(s)$ function (reflects the layout and strengths of the LHC magnets). The phase of the oscillations is given by $\phi(s)$ which is related to $\be(s)$ by $\d\phi/\d s = 1/\be(s)$.

From \Eq{ttm hill sol} one can read off the amplitude of the oscillations, which effectively determines the beam size:
\eqref{\si(s) = \sqrt{\be(s)\ep}\ .}{ttm beam sigma}
This quantity is often called a \em{beam sigma}. The beam size is of a special interest at the interaction point -- it characterizes the vertex distribution. Denoting $\be^*$ the value of the $\be(s)$ function at the interaction point, one can write
\eqref{\si_{x^*} = \sqrt{\be^* \ep}\ .}{ttm vertex sm}
By differentiating \Eq{ttm hill sol} one can obtain the evolution proton angles $\th_x = \d x/\d s$. Again, one can extract the amplitude of its oscillations, that is a measure of the beam angular divergence. Evaluating it at the IP yields
\eqref{\si_{\th^*} = \sqrt{\ep\over\be^*}\ .}{ttm beam div}

The solution \Eq{ttm hill sol} was derived for protons of the nominal momentum $p_{\rm nom}$. If the actual proton momentum differs by $\De p = \xi p_{\rm nom}$, one has to add a term $D(s) \xi$ to the solution, see Sc.~5.2 in~\bref{wilson}. Then, for the proton transport from the IP to a position $s$ one can write (see Sc.~5.2.4 in~\bref{wilson})
\eqref{x(s) =\ L_x(s, \ldots)\, \th_x^* + v_x(s,\ldots)\, x^* + D_x(s,\ldots)\,\xi}{ttm lin par}
and equivalently for the vertical direction. In the previous relation we have introduced the \em{effective length} $L$, the \em{magnification} $v$ and the \em{dispersion} $D$, we will refer to them as \em{optical functions}. These functions depend on the distance $s$ from the IP, but may also depend on the variables $\th_x^*$, $x^*$ and $\xi$. For the optics of practical interest, however, the dependence on $\xi$ is the only relevant one.

Strictly speaking, the form of \Eq{ttm lin par} is oversimplified. Due to higher order corrections, $x$ and $y$ projections are not strictly independent and consequently one should include also dependence on $\th_y^*$ and $y^*$. For the nominal optics these terms are negligible. However in reality, due to magnet misalignments (mostly their rotations), the binding between $x$ and $y$ projections may become important, see e.g.~\Fg{al el plots yx}.

In practice the optical functions are calculated with dedicated computer programs such as MAD-X \bref{mad-x}. Since they might be to slow for large Monte Carlo simulations, TOTEM's software (see \Sc{sr}) includes a module that calculates a polynomial parameterization of a MAD-X output, for details see Sc.~6.4 in \bref{hubert}.

For standard LHC runs one may expect relative error of beam momentum measurement
\eqref{\bar\xi = \O{10^{-3}}}{ttm energy off}
and the proton-to-proton momentum fluctuation
\eqref{\si_\xi = \O{10^{-4}}\ .}{ttm energy fl}

Since the optics \Eq{ttm lin par} relates the kinematics of a proton at the IP and the RP stations, it defines what protons can be detected with the (finite-size) RP detectors. Formally, one could think of an \em{acceptance} function $A(\th_x^*, x^*, \th_y^*, y^*, \xi)$ which gives $1$ if such a proton can be detected and $0$ otherwise. One can also take an average over the quantities that are not of interest. This may lead to, for example to acceptance $A(t, \xi)$, which gives the ratio protons with momentum transfer $t$ and momentum loss $\xi$ that can be detected. Similarly one may define the \em{elastic acceptance} $A(t)$ as the detected ratio of the elastic events with momentum transfer $t$. Several examples of the elastic acceptance are shown in \Fg{ttm elastic acceptance}.

%In an elastic measurement analysis (see e.g.~\Sc{felm}) one needs to correct for the limited acceptance. It is clear that when the acceptance is too low, the \em{acceptance correction} is large and 

\fig{fig/pdf/ttm_elastic_acceptance.pdf}{ttm elastic acceptance}{The elastic acceptances for the three optics types. Calculated for $\sqrt{s} = 14\un{TeV}$ and with RP sensors at $10\si + 0.5\un{mm}$. The horizontal line marks the points $|t_{30}|$ where the acceptances reach $30\percent$.}

The rich physics programme of TOTEM requires several running scenarios, including several optics. We will now review the foreseen scenarios, classified by the beta-function at the interaction point $\be^*$. Certain parameters have been calculated assuming the CMS energy of $\sqrt s = 14\un{TeV}$.

\> The \em{high $\be^*$} scenario is dedicated to the measurement of the total cross-section and low-$|t|$ elastic scattering. The optics with $\be^* = 1535\un{m}$ provides high effective lengths: $L_x$ up to $110\un{m}$ and $L_y$ up to $270\un{m}$ (both in the $220\un{m}$ stations). This ensures a good $t$-resolution (see \Sc{elr 1535}). To improve it further, this scenario counts with a reduced normalized emittance of $\ep_N=1\un{\mu m\ rad}$. This leads to a very low beam divergence at the IP $\si_{\th^*} = 0.3\un{\mu rad}$. The expected beam sizes (i.e. the beam sigmas) at the $220\un{m}$ stations are $\si_x = 0.03\un{mm}$ and $\si_y = 0.085\un{mm}$. The beam size, quite generally, determines the approach of the RPs to the beam -- a typical approach is about $10\si$ in each direction. The resulting elastic acceptance is drawn in red in \Fg{ttm elastic acceptance}. The acceptance reaches $30\percent$ at $|t_{30}| = 2\cdot10^{-3}\un{GeV^2}$. This scenario will use a rather low luminosity ${\cal L} \approx 10^{29} \hbox{ -- } 10^{30}\un{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$.

\> The \em{medium $\be^*$} scenario is based on a very universal optics with $\be^* = 90\un{m}$. It combines the properties of high and low $\be^*$ scenarios allowing for measurements of the total cross-section, medium-$|t|$ elastic scattering and certain diffractive processes. In the $220\un{m}$ stations the horizontal effective length $L_x$ is rather small, below $2.9\un{m}$, while in the vertical direction $L_y$ goes up to $260\un{m}$, which is similar to the high-$\be^*$ optics. The standard normalized emittance $\ep_{\rm N} = 3.75\un{\mu m\ rad}$ is planned to be used, leading to a beam divergence of about $2.4\un{\mu rad}$. The expected beam sizes at the $220\un{m}$ stations are $\si_x = 0.4\un{mm}$ and $\si_y = 0.59\un{mm}$. In other words, the pots will have to stay much further from the beam center than in the case of the high-$\be^*$ optics. Consequently, the elastic acceptance (blue histogram in \Fg{ttm elastic acceptance}) starts much later -- it reaches $30\percent$ only at $4\cdot 10^{-2}\un{GeV^2}$. This scenario counts with a luminosity of ${\cal L} \approx 10^{30}\un{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$.

\> The \em{low $\be^*$} runs will be used for large-$\xi$ diffractive studies and large-$|t|$ elastic scattering measurements (the data analyzed in \Sc{felm} were obtained with this type of optics). These scenarios with $\be^*$ between $0.5$ and $3\un{m}$ are optimized for high luminosities ${\cal L} \approx 10^{32} \hbox{ -- } 10^{33}\un{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ and not for forward proton detection -- the effective length at the $220\un{m}$ stations do not exceed $L_x = 2\un{m}$ and $20\un{m}$. With the standard normalized emittance $\ep_{\rm N} = 3.75\un{\mu m\ rad}$ the beam divergence is rather large: $\si_{\th^*} \approx 16\un{\mu rad}$. The beam sizes at the $220\un{m}$ are about $\si_x = 0.1\un{mm}$ and $\si_y = 0.3\un{mm}$. The elastic acceptance (green histogram in \Fg{ttm elastic acceptance}) reaches $30\percent$ at $|t_{30}| = 2.5\un{GeV^2}$.

\vskip\itskip

\Fg{ttm hit distribution} illustrates the properties of the three types of optics. The horizontal (vertical) spread of hits is controlled by the horizontal effective length $L_x$ (the vertical $L_y$). That is why the $\be^* = 90$ and $2\un{m}$ optics yield very narrow elastic scattering hit distributions. The gray ellipses show $10\si$ contours, thereby controlling the positions of the RPs.

}{ttm li meth}

The differential rate $\d N/\d t$ at $t=0\un{GeV^2}$ can not be measured directly, it can only be extrapolated from the measured low $|t|$ data. As discussed in \Sc{rp measurement}, there are two optics that extend to sufficiently low $|t|$ values: $\be^* = 1535$ and $90\un{m}$ (see the acceptance curves in \Fg{ttm elastic acceptance}). This extrapolation procedure is important also for the (integral) elastic rate $N_{\rm el}$ measurement as it allows to correct for the events missed due to the finite acceptance.

Looking at the low-$|t|$ elastic cross-section predictions in \Fg{el mod dsdt narrow}, one can see an ``almost'' exponential decrease. This observation can be better quantified by plotting the exponential slope \Eq{el B}, see \Fg{ext B}. The slope is not strictly constant, but for most models (except the one of Islam et al.) its variation is not large up to $|t| \approx 0.25\un{GeV^2}$. Moreover, the shape of the curves suggests that they can be well approximated by a polynomial of a low degree (such as a parabola). Thus the modulus of the hadronic amplitude can be parameterized as:
\eqref{|\FH(t)| = \e^{M(t)}\ ,\qquad M(t) \hbox{ a polynomial.}}{ext M par}

The previous parameterization is related to the hadronic amplitude $\FH$. However, the measured $t$-distribution relates to the cross-section due to both hadronic and Coulomb interactions: $\d\si^{\rm C+H}/\d t$ (see \Sc{el coulomb}). Moreover the experimental $t$-distribution is affected by the limited acceptance and detector resolution. These two effects need to be taken into account in the extrapolation procedure. Looking at the \Fg{ext C}, one may conclude that while the effect of the Coulomb interaction is important for the $1535\un{m}$ optics, it is practically negligible for the $90\un{m}$ optics (staying below $|t| \approx 0.25\un{GeV^2}$). It is the other way round for the smearing effects -- negligible for the $1535\un{m}$ and relevant for the $90\un{m}$ optics, see \Fg{ext smearing}.

\caption{Extrapolation for $\be^* = 1535\un{m}$ optics}

Since the Coulomb-interaction effects are relevant for this optics and since these effects act on the level of amplitude (not cross-section, see \Sc{el coulomb}), we need to extend the parameterization \Eq{ext M par} to include also a phase component. \Fg{el mod phase} suggests that, for $|t| \ls 0.25\un{GeV^2}$, a polynomial parameterization is adequate again. Thus, the hadronic amplitude can be parameterized as:
\eqref{\FH(t) = \e^{M(t)} \e^{\i P(t)}\ ,\qquad M(t), P(t) \hbox{ polynomials.}}{ext MP par}

In the rest of this section we will present the main results of an old extrapolation study, made even before the TOTEM offline software (see \Sc{sr}) existed. That is why we used only a simplified MC simulation -- comparable with the fast simulation presented in \Sc{fast simu}, including a simulation of the beam smearing effects similar to \Sc{beam smearing}. The size of the MC sample was chosen to correspond to about a day of data-taking with a realistic luminosity (see \Sc{rp measurement}).

The fitting procedure was based on the parameterization \Eq{ext MP par}. In principle this should be inserted into the Coulomb-interference formulae \Eq{el F CH decomp H,el phase CKL} and cross-section definition \Eq{el dsdt} in order to obtain a full fitting model. However, pursuing this approach would be too time consuming, mainly due to the numerical integrations in \Eq{el phase CKL}. Instead, we performed data fits directly with the parameterization \Eq{ext MP par}, but in several iterations. After each iteration we used the fit parameters to correct the input data for the presence of the Coulomb-interaction. After such a correction, the data effectively corresponded to the hadronic part of the cross-section only.

% corrections by iterations: data = U0 (U is uncorrected, C is corrected), guess C0 (e.g. by taking C0 = U0), then iterate: Ci --> Ui --> corr(i) = Ci/Ui --> C(i+1) = U0 * corr(i) and again unless |C(i+1) - C(i)| < threshold

We made a number of fits, trying to find such fit settings that minimize the deviation of the extrapolated cross-section at $t=0\un{GeV^2}$ from its original value. The parameters to optimize included: the lever-arm (the lower $|t|_{\rm low}$ and upper bound $|t|_{\rm up}$ of the fit), the binning of the input data, the degrees of modulus $M(t)$ and phase $P(t)$ polynomials and the number of Coulomb-correction iterations. We aimed at performing this optimization in a ``model independent way'' -- we used five model variants from \Sc{el models} and tried to minimize the mean extrapolated-original deviation.

\Fg{ext results 1535} shows probably the most interesting result of the study -- the dependence of the extrapolation deviation on the lower bound of the fit. This extrapolation was performed with a cubic modulus polynomial $M(t)$, constant phase polynomial $P(t)$, one Coulomb-correction iteration and the upper bound $|t|_{\rm up} = 0.054\un{GeV^2}$. For most of the models, the deviation lies in a band $\pm 0.2\percent$. The increasing deviation of the model of Islam et al.~might be explained by its exponential slope behavior, see \Fg{ext B}. It is deviating most from a constant value and the polynomial approximation is likely to be less accurate than for the other models.

\caption{Extrapolation for $\be^* = 90\un{m}$ optics}

For the $\be^* = 90\un{m}$, the situation is quite different. The acceptance only starts at higher $|t|$ values, where the Coulomb effects can be neglected (see \Fg{ext C}). This means that it is not necessary to include a phase part of the hadronic amplitude $\FH$ as in \Eq{ext MP par} and one can use the parameterization \Eq{ext M par}. 

Another difference compared to the $1535\un{m}$ optics is the much more pronounced beam smearing, its effects are quantified in \Fg{ext smearing}. The dominant error contribution is coming from the horizontal scattering angle $\th_x^*$ reconstruction, see \Fg{elr 90 dth}.

In principle, for the extrapolation one may use a very similar method as for the $1535\un{m}$ optics. One would just replace the Coulomb-correction iterations with smearing-correction iterations. However, we tried another approach. An approach that might be used even if $t_x$ could not be measured at all. In such a case, one can only work with a ``vertical'' cross-section $\d\si/\d t_y$. This can be transformed into the full cross-section $\d\si/\d t$ by exploiting the azimuthal symmetry (thus $\d\si/\d t_x = \d\si/\d t_y$) and the first relation from \Eq{ttm t th}:
\eqref{{\d\si\over\d t}(t) \propto \int\limits_t^0 \d u\, {\d\si\over\d t_y}(u)\, {\d\si\over\d t_y}(t - u)\ .}{ext dsdty to dsdt}
However, since low $|t_y|$ information is missing (out of acceptance), an extrapolation step would be needed just for this transformation. It therefore turns out better to transform the $t$-parameterization \Eq{ext M par} in a $t_y$-parameterization and fit it directly through $t_y$ data. The transform follows from the relation between $t$ and $t_y$ \Eq{ttm t x y}. Again, assuming the azimuthal symmetry ($\ph$ is uniformly distributed), one can write
\eqref{{\d\si\over\d t_y}(t_y) = {2\over\pi} \int\limits_{0}^{\pi/2} {\d\ph\over\sin^2\ph}\ \ {\d\si\over\d t}\!\left(t_y\over\sin^2\ph\right)\ .}{ext dsdt dsdty}
This transform can now by applied to the parameterization \Eq{ext M par}. Moreover, considering that the quadratic and higher terms of the polynomial $M(t)$ do not carry essential contributions (see \Fg{ext B}), one can approximate:
\eqref{{\d\si\over\d t} = e^{a\, +\, bt\, +\, ct^2\, +\, \ldots} \quad\Rightarrow\quad {\d\si\over\d t_y}(t_y) \approx {1\over\sqrt{\pi}}\, {e^{a\, +\, bt_y\, +\, ct_y^2\, +\, \ldots}\over\sqrt{|b\,t_y|}}\ .}{ext dsdt dsdty app}

To test this extrapolation approach, we used the same (simplified) MC simulation as for the $1535\un{m}$ optics. The main results are shown in \Fg{ext results 90}. We fitted the $t_y$ distribution with the parameterization \Eq{ext dsdt dsdty app} to extract the $a$ parameter, which determines the cross-section at $t=0\un{GeV^2}$. The fits were carried out on intervals from $|t_y|_{\rm low}$ (horizontal axis) to $|t_y| = 0.25\un{GeV^2}$. No attempt was made to correct for the smearing effects, which results to the overall offset $-2\percent$. But there is no problem to include such a correction in future. Most models fall in a band $\pm 1\percent$ around the offset $-2\percent$. The model of Islam et al.~deviates a bit more. Looking back to \Fg{ext B} one can see the exponential slope $B(t)$ being more curved for the model of Islam than for the others. Therefore the approximation \Eq{ext dsdt dsdty app} is less accurate for this model.
