\chapter{The TOTEM experiment}

MOTIVATION: The forward hadronic physics is one of the least explored and understood areas of the particle physics.

WHAT: The physics programme of the TOTEM experiment includes:
\> elastic scattering measurement in a wide $t$-range,
\> total cross-section measurement and
\> a study of soft and hard diffraction.

\TODO{add the phi vs. eta diagram to explain the forwardness?}

HOW (detectors): This challenging program brings special requirements for the detector apparatus. In particular large rapidity coverage - to detect most fragments from inelastic collisions and excellent acceptance for outgoing elastic and diffractive protons. To accomplish this task, TOTEM comprises three subdetectors: the telescopes T1 and T2 to detect products of inelastic collisions and a system of Roman Pots (RP) for surviving proton detection.

\TODO{acceptance overview plot? Our acceptance starts where CMS stops}

\> brief description of T1 and T2 with a few pictures
\>> reference to more detailed information: \bref{totem04,totem08,totem10}

\> describe the RP system
\>> motivation: very small angles -- need move close to the beam and detectors far from the IP
\>> break down with pictures, few info about the sensors
\>> define the standard naming: \bref{totem-rp-naming}

\section[rp measurement]{Proton Measurement with Roman Pot detectors}

\fig{fig/pdf/ttm_proton_transport.pdf}{ttm proton transport}{A scheme of the proton transport from the interaction point to a RP station. $y_{\rm N}$ and $y_{\rm F}$ are the hit points in the near and far units of the station.}


Imagine a collision which takes place at a \em{vertex}
\eqref{(x^*, y^*, s^*)^\T}{ttm ip vertex}
and where a proton is created, as sketched in \Fg{ttm proton transport}. One may relate the momentum $p$ of the outgoing proton to the nominal beam momentum
\eqref{p^* = p_{\rm nom} (1 - \xi^*)\ ,}{ttm xi}
where $\xi^*$ is the \em{momentum loss}. The direction of the proton is described by the \em{scattering angle} $\th^*$ and the \em{azimuthal angle} $\ph^*$:
\eqref{\vec p^* = p^* \pmatrix{\sin\th^* \cos\ph^*\cr \sin\th^*\sin\ph^* \cr \cos\th^*}
%=  p \pmatrix{\th_x\cr \th_y\cr \sqrt{1 - \th_x^2 - \th_y^2}}
\ .}{ttm mom comp}
The coordinate system $(x, y, s)$ is illustrated in \Fg{ttm proton transport}, the $s$ axis represents the beam axis.

The protons of our interest are scattered to low angles and therefore they stay close the outgoing beam and they enter the LHC magnet lattice. When the outgoing proton reaches the region of a RP station, it has momentum $p$, direction described by angles $\th$ and $\ph$ and may hit the detectors at points $x_{\rm N}$ and $x_{\rm F}$ just as shown in \Fg{ttm proton transport}.

We will use the notation that quantities related to the IP will be denoted with a star superscript, those without will be related to RP stations. Energy of the protons shall be conserved during the LHC transport from the IP to RP stations, therefore $p = p^*$ and $\xi = \si^*$. Thus we will not make distinction between their IP and RP values.

It will be useful to define the \em{projections of the scattering angle} (both for IP and RP-station quantities)
\eqref{\th_x = \th \cos\ph\ ,\qquad \th_y = \th \sin\ph\ .}{ttm th x y}
Similarly, one can define the projections of the momentum transfer $t$:
\eqref{t_x = t \cos^2\ph^*\ ,\qquad t_y = t \sin^2\ph^*\ ,}{ttm t x y}
This definition follows, in fact, from the low-scattering-angle approximation in \Eq{el t}, which we will commonly use in what follows (the scattering angles of interest are at most of the order $10^{-3}\un{rad}$, see e.g. \Fg{el mod dsdt large}). The definitions \Eq{ttm th x y,ttm t x y} yield relations
\eqref{t = t_x + t_y = - p^2 \th^{*2} = - p^2 (\th_x^{*2} + \th_y^{*2})\ .}{ttm t th}

Since the magnetic field within the RP stations is negligible, protons follow a straight trajectory there. The relation between RP sensor measurements and the parameters of the trajectory is, therefore simple (for details see \Sc{al tb}). What is much more interesting is the proton transport from the IP to the RP stations. We will discuss it in the rest of this section.

The differential rate at $t=0\un{GeV^2}$ can not be measured directly, it needs to be extrapolated from measured low $|t|$ data. As shown in \Fg{elastic acceptance}, there are two optics that extend to sufficiently low $|t|$ values: $\be^* = 1535$ and $90\un{m}$. This extrapolation procedure is important also for the (integral) elastic rate $N_{\rm el}$ measurement as it allows to correct for the events missed due to the finite acceptance.

\> what one measures is $h(t')$ -- includes smearing and acceptance and both interactions (hadronic + em)
\>> one needs to correct measured to hadronic (+unsmeared, acc. corr.)
\>> for 1535 smearing is not a problem (need a justification), but Coulomb can go large (below few$\cdot 10^{-3}\un{GeV^2}$)
