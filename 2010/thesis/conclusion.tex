In the first chapter we have presented a number of predictions of the best known hadronic models of elastic $\rm pp$ scattering for two LHC energies $\sqrt s = 7$ and $14\un{TeV}$. A comparison to the first LHC data at $\sqrt s = 7\un{TeV}$ will be shown at the end of this conclusion chapter. Then, in \Sc{el coulomb} we have discussed the interference between the electromagnetic and strong (hadronic) interactions. For the electromagnetic scattering, we have first proposed an effective form-factor that combines the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton. We have expressed our suspicion that the commonly used OPE approximation may not be accurate for momentum transfers $|t|$ above $1\un{GeV^2}$. We outlined several approaches to the Coulomb-hadronic interference. We have found the derivation of \WaY{} formula inconsistent. We have identified a complication in the derivation of \KaL{} formula which, however, has no numerical consequences. All the discussed formulae were derived in $\O{\al}$ approximations. We have compared their predictions to a new eikonal calculation to all orders of $\al$. When the form factors have been omitted, we have found a significant differences. Generally, we have found the formula of \KaL{} the best tool available for experimental data analyses. But still, for momentum transfers above $1\un{GeV^2}$ we expect sizable corrections due to multi-photon exchange effects that are not included in the present eikonal description.

In the third chapter, we have described the RP simulation and reconstruction software. The modules developed by the author of this thesis have been then discussed in detail.

When the alignment procedure from \Sc{al} was applied to the 2010 LHC runs, the relative misalignments among the sensors of one unit were reduced to about $1\un{\mu m}$ of transverse shift and $0.1\un{mrad}$ of rotation about the beam axis. The alignment of units with respect to the beam was achieved with an uncertainty of about $5\un{\mu m}$ in the horizontal direction and $15\un{\mu m}$ in the vertical (for the run used for the elastic cross-section determination in \Sc{felm}).

In the fifth chapter, we have presented TOTEM's first measurement of the $\rm pp$ differential cross-section at $\sqrt s = 7\un{TeV}$. The final result, compared to the predictions of the models from \Sc{el models} and the model of Jenkovszky et al.~\bref{jenkovszky11}, is shown in \Fg{ttm mod cmp dsdt}. The discriminative power of TOTEM's measurement is evident. In region below the diffractive dip, $|t| \ls 0.5\un{GeV^2}$ there is a relatively good agreement among the models themselves and the measurement. But for momentum transfers $|t|$ between $0.5$ and $1\un{GeV^2}$ the models exhibit rather large spread in their predictions (one and half orders), moreover the measurement of TOTEM does not favour any the presented models. The measurement falls into a gap between two bands of predictions (one band is formed by the models of Islam et al., Petrov et al.~with two pomerons and Jenkovszky et al., the other band is formed by the models of Block et al., Bourrely et al.~and Petrov et al.~with three pomerons).

We have extracted the exponential slope $B$ (see \Eq{el B}) from TOTEM's cross-section measurement (thick black histogram in \Fg{ttm mod cmp dsdt}). We have split the histogram into groups of six consecutive bins. Each of these groups was fitted with an exponential, resulting in a point in in \Fg{ttm mod cmp B}. The horizontal error bars indicate the span of the six-bin group, the vertical error bars reflect the fit uncertainty. The discriminative power of this plot is smaller ($B$ accounts only for the ``shape'' and not the normalization of the cross-section), but still one can conclude that the models of Jenkovszky et al.~and of Petrov et al.~(the two-pomeron version) are disfavored by TOTEM's data.
