This also gives estimate about the rotation

\section{What misalignments are relevant?}

As it follows from \Sc{rp measurement}, only the rotation around $z$ axis is relevant.

\section{Track--based alignment}

In \Sc{rp measurement}, the relation between a proton kinematics and RP detector measurement has been derived -- see \Eq{xlyl i approximated}. In principle, all geometry parameters (the situation is depicted in \Fg{detector geometry}) may be subjects to misalignments. Using primes (no primes) for misaligned (ideal) quantities, this might be described as
\eqref{\eqnarray{
z' &=& z + \De z\cr
\vec c' &=& \vec c + \De\vec c\cr
}}{misalignment definition}
(The z component of the $\vec c$ vector will be denoted simply as $z$ from now on, while $\vec c$ will refer to the two-component vector $(c_x, c_y)^\T$). The $\rh_z$ already refers to misalignment. In this regard, we will change the notation
\eqref{\rh_z \rightarrow \De\rh}{misalignment definition 2}
(the $z$ subscript will be dropped as it is the only rotation in our picture from now on).

With the new notation, one can write
\eqref{
\vec d^\T \pmatrix{1 & \De\rh\cr -\De\rh & 1} =
\vec d + \De\rh \underbrace{\pmatrix{-d_y\cr d_x}}_{\vec d_\perp}\ .
}{d perp definition}

\fig{fig/pdf/detector_geometry.pdf}{detector geometry}{The detector geometry. A sample hit is drawn as the blue dot, the corresponding measurement is visualized as the thick solid blue line.}

To summarize, the measurement of the $n$-th event in the $i$-th detector is
\eqref{
m_i^n = (\vec d_i + \De\rh_i\,\vec d_{\perp i})^\T \left[\vec a^n (z_i + \De z_i) + \vec b^n - (\vec c_i + \De\vec c_i)\right] + \De m_i^n\ ,
}{n i measurement}
where the last term includes the errors introduced by various approximations and by neglecting the ``rounding'' step. It will be treated as an error in what follows. One can rearrange the terms in the last equation
\eqref{\eqnarray{
\mu_i^n \equiv m_i^n - \vec d^\T \vec c = & &\cr
& +\vec d_i^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n)&\qquad 10^{-2}\un{m}\cr
& -\vec d_i^\T \De\vec c_i&\qquad 10^{-5}\un{m}\cr
& +\vec d_i^\T \vec a^n \De z_i&\qquad 10^{-??}\un{m} \cr
& +\De \rh_i\ \vec d_{\perp i}^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i) &\qquad 10^{-5}\un{m} \cr
& +\De \rh_i\ \vec d_{\perp i}^\T (\vec a^n \De z_i - \De\vec c_i) &\qquad 10^{-8}\un{m} \cr
}}{effective measurement}
The order estimates on the \rhs{} follow from \Tb{expected misalignments} and \Eq{z i order estimates}. It is clear that the last term can be neglected with respect to the others and hence we will do so. It is very advantageous since this is the only term non-linear in misalignments. 

The first term on the \rhs{} of \Eq{effective measurement} accounts for the measurement of a track by a perfectly aligned detector, the other terms then constitute alignment corrections. Since these corrections are linear in misalignments, one can write
\eqref{\mu_i^n =
\underbrace{\vec d_i^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n)}_{\hbox{track}}
+
\underbrace{\sum_j \ga_{j, i}^n \ch_{j, i}}_{\hbox{alignment corrections}}
\ ,}{effective measurement 2}
introducing symbol $\ch_{j, i}$ for any misalignment. The mapping between the index $j$ and misalignment type can be found in \Tb{alignment quantities}.

}

\Eq{effective measurement 2} can written for all events in a compact form using matrix formalism. Let's put all measurements to a vector
\eqref{\vec M = (\mu^1_1 \ldots, \mu^2_1, \ldots)^\T\ .}{vector M}
The vector of parameters $\vec P$ has two parts, first the track parameters for all events, second the alignment parameters for all detectors
\eqref{\vec P = (a_x^1, a_y^1, b_x^1, b_y^1, a_x^2, \ldots || \ch_{1, 1}\ldots \ch_{1, D}, \ch_{2, 1}\dots \ch_{2, D}, \ldots)^\T}{vector P}
Then, \Eq{effective measurement 2} reads
\eqref{\vec M = \mat A \vec P\ ,}{effective measurement all}

\eqref{\mat A = \pmatrix{

\subsection{Simultaneous fit of track and alignment parameters}

This idea was first implemented in Millepede (see \bref{millepede}). Here we use different notation as this work as been done independently.

Now we would like to estimate parameters $\vec P$ based on the measurements $\vec M$. For that, we can use the Least Squares method \TODO{reference}, which gives the following prediction:
\eqref{\hat\vec P = (\mat A^\T \mat A)^{-1} \mat A^\T\,\vec M\.}{P estimate exact}
(The hat is to emphasize it is an estimate.) However, the $\mat\Ga$ matrices (contained in $\mat A$ matrix) include track parameters which are unknown at the fit time. Instead, one can use track parameter estimates obtained via model where all misalignments are neglected. This is basically using $\mat \al^n$ as fit matrix for data $\vec \mu^n$. Let's denote gamma and A matrices obtained in this way as $\tilde\mat\Ga$ and $\tilde\mat A$:
\eqref{\vec\ta \rightarrow \hat\vec\ta: \quad \mat\Ga \rightarrow \tilde\mat\Ga, \mat A \rightarrow \tilde\mat A}{tau linearization}
 One can then use
\eqref{\hat\vec P = (\tilde\mat A^\T \tilde\mat A)^{-1} \tilde\mat A^\T\,\vec M\ .}{P estimate}

The \rhs expression will be evaluated now bit by bit, keeping in mind one is mainly interested in the $\ch$ parameters (i.e. the bottom part of $\hat\vec P$ vector).
\eqref{\mat A^\T \mat A = \pmatrix{
{\mat\al^1}^\T \mat\al^1	&		&						&\vrule	&{\mat\al^1}^\T\mat\Ga_1^1	&\cdots	&{\mat\al^1}^\T\mat\Ga_G^1	\cr
					&\ddots	&						&\vrule	&\vdots					&		&\vdots					\cr
					&		&{\mat\al^N}^\T \mat\al^N		&\vrule	&{\mat\al^N}^\T\mat\Ga_1^N	&\cdots	&{\mat\al^N}^\T\mat\Ga_G^N	\cr
\noalign{\hrule}
{\mat\Ga_1^1}^\T \mat\al	&\cdots	&{\mat\Ga_1^N}^\T \mat\al	&\vrule	&\sum_n {\Ga_1^n}^\T \Ga_1^n	&\cdots	&\sum_n {\Ga_1^n}^\T\Ga_G^n	\cr

}\ .}{mat ATA}
This matrix can be inverted (\TODO{provided ...}) with the use of the following identity for block matrices (taken from \bref{wikipedia} keyword \em{matrix inverse}): 
\eqref{\pmatrix{
\mat A	&\strut\vrule	&\mat B	\cr
\noalign{\hrule}
\mat C	&\strut\vrule	&\mat D\cr
}^{-1} = \pmatrix{
\ldots							&\strut\vrule	&\ldots\cr
\noalign{\hrule}
-\mat S^{-1}\mat C\mat A^{-1}	&\strut\vrule	& \mat S^{-1}\cr
},\qquad \mat S = \mat D - \mat C\mat A^{-1}\mat B\ .}{BlockInverse}
(The upper row was skipped as it will not be needed to estimate $\ch$ parameters.) After some algebra manipulations, matrix $\mat S$ can be written
\eqref{\tilde\mat S = \pmatrix{
\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_1^{n^\T} \mat\si^n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_1^n	&\cdots	&\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_1^{n^\T} \mat\si^n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_G^n	\cr
\vdots								&		&\vdots									\cr
\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_G^{n^\T} \mat\si^n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_1^n	&\cdots	&\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_G^{n^\T} \mat\si^n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_G^n	\cr
},\qquad \mat\si^n = 1 - \mat\al^n({\mat\al^n}^\T\mat\al^n)^{-1}{\mat\al^n}^\T\ .}{mat S}

The second bit needed for \Eq{P estimate} is
\eqref{\mat A^\T\,\vec M = \pmatrix{
{\mat\al^n}^\T\,\vec \mu^1\cr
\vdots\cr
{\mat\al^n}^\T\,\vec \mu^N\strut\cr
\ln
\sum_n\mat{\Ga_1^n}^\T\, \vec \mu^n\vrule width0pt height15pt\cr
\vdots\cr
\sum_n\mat{\Ga_G^n}^\T\, \vec \mu^n\cr
}\ .}{vec ATm}
Finally, the $\ch$ parameters (the bottom part of $\hat\vec P$ vector) can be determined from
\eqref{\hat\vec\ch = \mat S^{-1}\,\pmatrix{
\sum_n {\mat\Ga_1^n}^\T\mat\,\mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n\cr
\vdots\cr
\sum_n {\mat\Ga_G^n}^\T\mat\,\mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n\cr
}\ .}{chi estimate}

$\mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n$ is the vector of one-track-fit residuals for the $n$-track. Therefore we will adopt notation
\eqref{\vec R^n = \mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n}{vec R}

As $\mat\si^n$ is singular (and so $\mat S$ might be \TODO{...}), one had better write
\eqref{\tilde \mat S\, \hat\vec\ch = \tilde \vec T, \qquad 
\tilde\vec T = \pmatrix{
\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_1^{n^\T} \,\vec R^n\cr
\vdots\cr
\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_G^{n^\T} \,\vec R^n\cr
}\ .}{fit equation}


\subsection[fit equation]{Justification of the alignment equation}

As we will show in the following, the $\mat S$ matrix is singular and therefore the identity \Eq{BlockInverse} cannot be used. Thus, it is important to justify the validity of the final result \Eq{fit equation}. By plugging \Eq{vec R,todo1} to the definition of $\tilde\vec T$ in \Eq{fit equation} one obtains
\eqref{\tilde\vec T =
\pmatrix{
\vdots \cr
\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^{n^\T} \mat\si^n \vec\mu^n\cr
\vdots \cr
}
=
\pmatrix{
\ddots & & \udots \cr
 & \sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^{n^\T} \mat\si^n \mat\Ga_i^n\cr
\udots & & \ddots \cr
}
\pmatrix{\vdots \cr {\vec\ch_{\rm a}}_i \cr \vdots}
=
\bar\mat S \vec\ch_{\rm a}
}{exact fit equation}
(the a subscript in $\vec\ch_{\rm a}$ is to emphasize the we mean the actual misalignments). This is close to \Eq{fit equation}, but not completely equivalent. The difference is that $\tilde\mat S$ contains both $\mat\Ga$ matrices with tildes. This difference represents the error we make by the linearization step \Eq{tau linearization}. Since the expected misalignments are small, the difference between $\mat\Ga$ and $\tilde\mat\Ga$ are small too and it is reasonable to expect that the solution of \Eq{fit equation} would be close to the actual misalignments $\vec\ch_a$. The error can be reduced by taking several iterations \TODO{...}. Note that this problem is not present if only shifts in the read-out direction are considered. The corresponding $\mat\Ga$ matrices are independent of track parameters and therefore there is no difference between tilded and non-tilded versions.

\subsection{Singular modes and constraints}

It is clear that not all $\ch$ parameters can be determined by the track-based alignment. It is a consequence of the fact that measurements enter the fit equation \Eq{fit equation} in the form of residuals. That means that misalignment modes that can be compensated by track-parameters variation, cannot be revealed. These misalignment modes manifest themselves as eigenvectors of the $\mat S$ matrix with zero eigenvalue. This makes $\mat S$ singular and the naive, matrix-inversion solution \Eq{chi estimate} is not possible. For this reason we will refer to such misalignment modes as \em{singular modes}.

\TODO{This is for the exact fit equation, for the real one, the singular modes are "almost" singular modes.}

Let's prove the statements above. Imagine that one could change misalignments $\vec\ch_j$ and track parameters $\vec\ta^n$ such that all measurments $\vec\mu^n$ in all events $n$ would remain unchanged. That is
\eqref{\vec\ch_j \rightarrow \vec\ch_j',\quad \vec\ta^n \rightarrow {\vec\ta'}^n(\vec\ta^n, \vec\ch_j, \vec\ch_j') : \quad \vec\mu^n \rightarrow {\vec\mu'}^n = \vec\mu^n\ .}{track-parameter compensation}
From \Eq{todo1} it follows
\eqref{\sum_j \mat\Ga_j^n (\vec\ch_j' - \vec\ch_j) = \mat \al^n (\vec\ta^n - {\vec\ta'}^n) }{aux1}
and thus
\eqref{
\mat S \pmatrix{\vdots\cr \vec\ch_i' - \vec\ch_i\cr\vdots} = 
\pmatrix{\vdots\cr \sum_n {\mat\Ga_i^n}^\T \mat\si^n \sum_j \Ga_j^n (\vec\ch_j' - \vec\ch_j) \cr\vdots} =
\pmatrix{\vdots\cr \sum_n {\mat\Ga_i^n}^\T \mat\si^n \mat \al^n (\vec\ta^n - {\vec\ta'}^n) \cr\vdots} = 0\ ,
}{equivalence singular mode track parameter variation}
which is a direct consequence of $\mat\si^n \al^n = 0$.

Now, let's explore what are the singular modes that we have to face. This will done it two steps -- first for an arbitrary detector geometry and second for the actual case of TOTEM Roman Pots, where only two read-out directions are used.

\TODO{there can be at most 4 singular modes per misalignment class. Prove it!}

\ssubsection{Constraints for any geometry}

In this section we will discuss what the singular modes are when no assumptions about the geometry are made. That will be performed for all misalignment classes as listed in \Tb{alignment quantities}.

\em{Shifts in readout direction}. Let's try to find a variation of track parameters $\vec a^n$ and $\vec b^n$ that would compensate shifts $\De\vec c_i$. That is
\eqref{\vec d_i \cdot (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i - \De\vec c_i) = \vec d_i \cdot ({\vec a'}^n z_i + {\vec b'}^n - \vec c_i)\ .}{cnst shr 1}
If this is fulfilled, such $\De\vec c_i$ configurations will be singular modes, for all values of ${\vec a'}^n$ and ${\vec b'}^n$ vectors. Explicitly:
\eqref{- \De s_i \equiv -\vec d_i \cdot \De\vec c_i = \vec d_i \cdot \left[ ({\vec a'}^n - \vec a^n) z_i + ({\vec b'}^n - \vec b^n) \right]\ .}{cnst shr 2}
Since the ${\vec a'}^n$ and ${\vec b'}^n$ vectors are two-dimensional, there four singular modes:
\eqref{\De s_i \propto z_i\cos\rh_i,\quad \De s_i \propto z_i\sin\rh_i,\quad \De s_i \propto \cos\rh_i,\quad \De s_i \propto \sin\rh_i\ .}{cnst shr 3}
\TODO{Like columns of complete $\mat\al$ matrix. 2 shifts and 2 shearings.}


\em{Shifts in $z$}. 
\eqref{\vec d_i \cdot \left[ \vec a^n (z_i + \De z_i) + \vec b^n \right] = \vec d_i \cdot ({\vec a'}^n z_i + {\vec b'}^n)\ .}{cnst shz 1}
\eqref{\vec d_i \cdot \vec a^n \De z_i = \vec d_i \cdot (\De\vec a^n z_i + \De\vec b^n)\ .}{cnst shz 2}
This shall hold for every $\vec d_i$ and therefore one obtains
\eqref{\vec a^n \De z_i = \De\vec a^n z_i + \De\vec b^n\ .}{cnst shz 3}
Moreover, this must be obeyed for every value of $\vec a^n$, which is only possible if both $\De\vec a^n$ and $\De\vec b^n$ are proportional to $\vec a^n$. That means
\eqref{\De z_i = \al z_i + \be\ ,}{cnst shz 4}
where $\al$ and $\be$ are the proportionality constants. Thus there are two sinuglar modes (magnification and shift):
\eqref{\De z_i \propto z_i, \quad \De z_i \propto 1\ .}{cnst shz 5}

\em{Rotations around $z$}. We will use symbol $\mat R(\rh)$ for a rotation matrix around $z$ axis by angle $\rh$:
\eqref{\mat R(\rh) = \pmatrix{
\cos\rh & -\sin\rh \cr
\sin\rh & \cos\rh \cr
}\ .}{rotation matrix}
Again, let's search for track-parameter variations that could compensate a rotation. This time, we will include also transverse (read-out) misalignments as it will turn out that they are linked.
\eqref{[\mat R(\De\rh_i) \vec d_i]^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i - \De\vec c_i) = \vec d_i \cdot ({\vec a'}^n z_i + {\vec b'}^n - \vec c_i - \De\vec c'_i)\ .}{cnst rotz 1}
Since this must be fulfilled for all $\vec d_i$, one can write
\eqref{\mat R(\De\rh_i)^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i - \De\vec c_i) = {\vec a'}^n z_i + {\vec b'}^n - \vec c_i - \De\vec c'_i\ .}{cnst rotz 2}
Comparing $n$-dependent quantities, one finds
\eqref{\mat R(\De\rh_i)^\T \vec a^n z_i = {\vec a'}^n}{cnst rotz 3}
(and similarly for $\vec b^n$). This can be guaranteed only provided $\De\rh_i$ is $i$-independent, that is constant. Then it is easy to find that
\eqref{\De\vec c'_i = \mat R(\De\rh) \De\vec c_i + [\mat R(\De\rh) - 1] \vec c_i\ .}{cnst rotz 4}
The second term reflects the fact that the singular mode is a uniform rotation around the $z$ axis, while alignment rotations (described by angles $\De\rh_i$) are performed around detector axes. These axes are parallel, but displaced by vectors $\vec c_i$.

Considering the misalignment expectations (see \Tb{expected misalignments}), it is reasonable to replace the rotation matrix by the first Taylor terms and also neglect terms containing the product of $\De\rh$ and $\De\vec c_i$. These simplifications yield
\eqref{\De\vec c'_i = \De\vec c_i + \De\rh \pmatrix{
- {c_y}_i\cr
{c_x}_i\cr
} + \O{\De\rh^2, \De\rh \De\vec c_i}}{cnst rotz 5}
or in terms of read-out shift $s_i$
\eqref{\De s'_i = \De s_i + \De\rho\, \de s_i + \O{\De\rh^2, \De\rh \De\vec c_i}, \qquad \de s_i = \vec d_{\perp i}\cdot\vec c_i\ .}{cnst rotz 6}
To summarize, we have just derived that transition from overall rotation $\De\rh$ and shifts $\De s_i$ to zero rotation and shifts $\De s_i'$ generates a singular mode. This is the only singular mode for rotations, but it also involves shifts. It can be schematically written as
\eqref{
\pmatrix{
\De\rh_i \cr
\De s_i
} \propto \pmatrix{
1\cr
- \de s_i
}\ .}{cnst rotz 7}
\TODO{Check the minus sign.}


\ssubsection{Constraints for few read-out directions}

In the previous section, we have used the fact that certain equalities shall hold for all read-out directions $\vec d_i$. However, the TOTEM detectors are designed such that the read-out directions are all parallel to either $U$ or $V$ axes (\TODO{make sure these are defined}). In this section we will show that such a geometry may increase the number of singular modes. We will consider a more general case, where the detectors split into groups according to their read-out direction:
\eqref{\vec \d_i \in \lbrace \pm\vec\de_1, \pm\vec\de_2, \ldots \rbrace \ ,\qquad |\vec\de_i \cdot \vec\de_j| \neq 1\hbox{ for } i \neq j\ .}{read-out groups}

For \em{shifts in read-out direction} the assumption of all direction has not been used and thus the result \Eq{cnst shr 3} remains valid also for these geometries.

For \em{shifts in $z$} one gets a copy of \Eq{cnst shz 2} for every group $g$:
\eqref{\vec\de_g \cdot \vec a^n \De z_i = \vec\de_g \cdot (\De\vec a^n z_i + \De\vec b^n)\ ,}{cnst shz g1}
valid, indeed, for detectors $i$ from the group $g$. (note the $\pm$ signs cancel). Since this shall hold for all $\vec a^n$, the ratio $\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec a^n / \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n$ must be $n$-independent. That means constant, at least per group. Formally written (and similarly for the $\De\vec b^n$ term):
\eqref{
{\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec a^n \over \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n} = \al_g,\qquad
{\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec b^n \over \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n} = \be_g
\ .}{cnst shz g2}
For \em{one group}, there is infinite number of $\De\vec a^n$ vectors fulfilling this condition for a fixed value of $\al_1$. For \em{two groups}, there is a unique solution for given values $\al_1$ and $\al_2$. This means that singular modes are independent for each group, they are of form
\eqref{\De z_i = \al_g z_i + \be_g,\qquad \hbox{for groups }g \in \lbrace 1, 2\rbrace\ .}{cnst shz g3}
This means that the number of singular modes is doubled compared to \Eq{cnst shz 5}.

For \em{three and more groups}, the $\vec a^n$ vector is defined by two (let's say first and second) $\al$ values. Let's check what are the conditions for the other $\al$ values so as all requirements \Eq{cnst shz g2} are satisfied. Since $\vec\de_g$ vectors are two dimensional, one can put
\eqref{\vec\de_g = \et_{g1}\vec\de_1 + \et_{g2}\vec\de_2\ .}{cnst shz g4}
(For $g>2$ both $|\et| < 1$). Inserting that to \Eq{cnst shz g2} yields
\eqref{\al_g = {
\et_{g1} \vec\de_1\cdot\De\vec a^n \al_1 + \et_{g2} \vec\de_2\cdot\De\vec a^n \al_2
\over
\et_{g1} \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n + \et_{g2} \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n
}\ .}{cnst shz g5}
If $\al_1 \neq \al_2$, then $\al_g$ would become $n$-dependent, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution for this case. If $\al_1 = \al_2$, then all $\al_g$ are equal. This is exactly the solution \Eq{cnst shz 5} derived in the preceding section.

\em{Rotations around $z$}. Here, one can proceed in a similar way as for shift in z. One gets an analogy of \Eq{cnst rotz 3} for every group
\eqref{\de_g \cdot \mat R(\de\rh_i)^\T \vec a^n = \de_g \cdot {\vec a'}^n\ ,}{cnst rotz g1}
 which limits the dependence of $\De\rh$ only to group: $\De\rh_i \rightarrow \De\rh_g$. For \em{one} group there exist infinitely many solutions, for \em{two groups} there is exactly one. The solution has the form of \Eq{cnst rotz 7}, but separately for each groups -- therefore there are two linearly-independent singular modes. For \em{three and more groups}, the ${\vec a^n}'$ vector is fixed by two values of $\De\rh_g$ (again, take the first and second). Using the decomposition \Eq{cnst shz g4} one finds (in infinitesimal approximation)
\eqref{\De\rh_g = {
\et_{g1} \vec\de_1\cdot\De\vec a^n \De\rh_1 + \et_{g2} \vec\de_2\cdot\De\vec a^n \De\rh_2
\over
\et_{g1} \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n + \et_{g2} \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n
}\ .}{cnst rotz g5}
This is a similar result to \Eq{cnst shz g5} and thus the interpretation is similar too. There is no solution if $\De\rh_1 \neq \De\rh_2$ and if they are equal, then all $\De\rh_g$ are equal. This reveals the solution \Eq{cnst rotz 7} from the previous section.

The singular mode numbers are summarized in \Tb{singular mode number}.

\htab{singular mode number}{Numbers of singular modes for different geometry types.}{\bln

\hbox{rotation around}z				& 1 & 2\cr\bln
}

As it was already said, the \em{design} of the Roman Pot detectors is such that there would be only two read-out directions. However in \em{reality}, because of misalignment rotations, the number of read-out directions is as large as the number of detectors. But since the misalignments small only, one stays close to the 2-readout-direction case. This will manifest in presence of several modes with low but non-zero eigenvalues. It will lead to numerical issues that will be addressed in \Sc{align imp}.


\ssubsection{Constraints for RPShZ}

\ssubsection{Constrained solution}

To solve the fit equation \Eq{fit equation}, one has to imply additional constraints that would regularize the $\mat S$ matrix. For the alignment task, these constraints may be for example metrology or laster measurements. Such constraints may be written in the following form
\eqref{\vec C \cdot \hat\vec\ch = v\ ,}{cnst form}
where $\vec C$ describes the structure of the constraint and $v$ contains the measurement outcome.

To solve the fit equation with constraints, it is advantageous to employ the Lagrange multipliers technique (\TODO{reference}). It suggests to expand the fit equation to
\eqref{\pmatrix{
\tilde\mat S & \mat C \cr
\mat C^\T & 0\cr
} \pmatrix{
\hat\vec\ch \cr
\vec\La \cr
} = \pmatrix{
\vec T\cr
\vec V\cr
}\ ,}{alignment equation}
where the $\mat C$ matrix contains the $\vec C$ vectors (see \Eq{cnst form}) in columns for all constraints applied and vector $\vec V$ includes corresponding $v$'s. $\vec\La$ is the vector Lagrange multipliers. Let's demonstrate that this equation does what we want. First, let's rewrite as two equations
\eqref{\tilde\mat S \hat\vec\ch = \vec T - \mat C \vec\La \equiv \vec T'(\vec\La)\ ,}{cnst aux1}
\eqref{\mat C^\T \hat\vec\ch = \vec V\ .}{cnst aux2}
The second one obviously presents a series of constraints of type \Eq{cnst form}. Since $\mat S$ is symmetric (\TODO{ref}), it can be diagonalized as follows (see e.g. \bref{wikipedia} key \em{symmetric matrix})
\eqref{\mat S = \mat Q \mat D \mat Q^{-1}, \qquad
\mat D = \diag(\underbrace{0, \ldots}_{\vbox{\hbox{singular}\hbox{modes}}}; \underbrace{\la_1, \ldots}_{\vbox{\hbox{regular}\hbox{modes}}}), \qquad
\mat Q = (\underbrace{\vec s_1, \ldots}_{\vbox{\hbox{singular}\hbox{modes}}} ; \underbrace{\vec r_1, \ldots}_{\vbox{\hbox{regular}\hbox{modes}}})
\ ,}{cnst aux3}
where we have ordered the eigenvalues and eigenvectors such that all singular modes go first. Let's remark that we don't require eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue to form an ortonormal set (although we could). This will enable us to work with singular modes as derived above (without ortnormalizing them). Since $\mat Q$ is regular, one can put
\eqref{\mat D \mat Q^{-1} \hat\vec\ch = (\mat Q^\T \mat Q)^{-1} \mat Q^T \vec T'(\vec\La)}{cnst aux4}
and expand the parts for singular vectors
\eqref{
\pmatrix{
\ddots & & & \vrule & \cr
& 0 & & \vrule & \cr
& & \ddots & \vrule & \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
 & & & \vrule & \ddots \cr
}
\mat Q^{-1} \hat\vec\ch = 
\pmatrix{
& & & \vrule & \cr
& (\mat E^\T \mat E)^{-1} & & \vrule & \cr
& & & \vrule & \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
 & & & \vrule & \ddots \cr
}
\pmatrix{
\cr
\mat E^\T\cr
\cr
\noalign{\hrule}
\vdots\cr
}
\vec T'(\vec\La)
\ .}{cnst aux5}
(The $\mat E$ matrix contains the singular vectors $\vec s_i$ in columns). The part above the vertical line on the \lhs{} is identically equal to zero and thus so the \rhs{} must be. Considering that $\mat E^T \mat E$ is regular, one finds
\eqref{\mat E^\T \vec T = \mat E^\T \mat C \vec\La\ .}{cnst aux6}
In order to find solution $\vec\La$ for any $\vec T$,
\eqref{\mat E^\T \mat C\hbox{ must be regular}\ .}{cnst condition}
This condition defines what constraints may be used. We will discuss some convenient choices later on.

For the moment, let's get back to \Eq{cnst aux1}. (As $\vec\La$ has been resolved from \Eq{cnst aux6}, $\vec T'$ is known.) This equation has infinite number of solutions that can be written
\eqref{\hat\vec\ch(\vec\et) = \vec\ch^0 + \mat E \vec\et\ ,}{cnst aux7}
where $\vec\ch^0$ is a particular solution and $\vec\et$ are parameters in the solution space of the homogeneous equation. Inserting that to \Eq{cnst aux2} yields
\eqref{\vec\et = (\mat C^\T \mat E)^{-1} (\vec V - \vec C^\T \vec\ch^0)}{cnts aux8}
and therefore \Eq{alignment equation} has always a unique solution that satisfies all constraints \Eq{cnst form}.

Now it would be nice to show that the actual misalignments can play the role of $\vec\ch^0$. Unfortunately, this is the case only for shifts in the read-out direction. For the other misalignment classes it is violated because of the linearization step \Eq{tau linearization} -- see section \Sc{fit equation}. Combining \Eq{exact fit equation,cnst aux6} yields
\eqref{\vec\La = (\mat E^\T \mat C)^{-1} \mat E^\T \bar\mat S \vec\ch_a\ .}{cnst aux9}
If we were not forced to make the linearization step \Eq{tau linearization}, $\mat E$ would contain singular vectors of $\bar\mat S$ and thus their product would be identically zero. Then, $\vec\La = 0$, $\tilde\vec T = \vec T$ and \Eq{cnst aux1} would become trivial
\eqref{\tilde\mat S \hat\vec\ch = \tilde\mat S \vec\ch_{\rm a}\ ,}{cnst aux10}
which demonstrates that $\vec\ch_{\rm a}$ could play the role of the particular solution $\vec\ch^0$.

\TODO{Even with the linearization step, we will be assuming the same singular vectors for $\tilde\mat S$ as for $\bar\mat S$, hence $\vec\La = 0$ and the particular would obey
\eqref{\tilde\mat S \vec\ch^0 = \bar\mat S \vec\ch_{\rm a}}{cnst aux11}
$\vec\ch^0$ close to $\vec\ch_{\rm a}$ ...

\ssubsection{Comparison to optical measurements}

The position of the detectors within the RP assembly has been measured. There are 3 reference points on a detector and one point on the RP. For each detector a zoomed high resolution photo was taken and a relative position of the points 1 and 2 (see \Fg{opticalMetrology}) and the RP reference point was measured. Theoretical values and results are summarized in \Tb{metrology theoretical}. The precision of this measurement is $\approx 10\un{\mu m}$.
