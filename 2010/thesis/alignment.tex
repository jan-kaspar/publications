\chapter[al]{Alignment of Roman Pots}

\TODO{!! ADD CITATIONS !!}

MOTIVATION: An accurate alignment is of major importance for the TOTEM experiment in order to deliver precise measurements. Among the subdetectors of TOTEM, the alignment of the RPs presents the biggest challenge since they are movable. The importance of alignment is most pronounced at the $\be^* = 1535\un{m}$ optics, where the beam divergence (the dominant smearing effect) is rather low and thus the impact of any misalignment has a large relevance. To give a feeling, a $100\un{\mu m}$ displacement of a vertical RP would lead to angular shift of about $0.4\un{\mu rad}$ (based on an effective length $L_y\approx 270\un{m}$, typical for this optics). This is to be compared to the spread of the beam divergence $0.3\un{\mu rad}$.

\TODO{experience from other experiments}

WHAT WE ALIGN, WRT WHAT:
What is important is the relative position between RP sensors (the other parts do not matter much) and the beam. Hence there are two players in the game -- RP positions and beam positions.

Coordinate system such that the beam is at x=y=0

\section[al proc]{Alignment procedure}
The procedure has two steps. First, move the pots to the desired position as precisely as possible. Then take data, analyze them and find what error has been done in the first step.

The first step relies mainly on two types devices -- RP motor control and Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). Both are calibrated to determine position of outer edge of the window or the beam with respect to the ideal beam-pipe center.

For the second step, a number of methods is available. Undoubtedly, one of the most powerful ones is the track-based alignment. It uses the tracks passing through the overlap between vertical and horizontal RPs and is, therefore, capable of determining the relative position between the pots. Its strength is underlined by the fact that it is based on a single assumption: tracks are straight lines. To determine the position of the beam, other methods must be used. One may profit from know symmetries of certain physics processes. Here, the analysis becomes delicate because in the observables the properties of the processes are mixed with the properties of the optics. This gives a certain superiority to elastic scattering. This process is often easy to separate and thus can provide a clean sample, as the first argument. As the second one, it comprises two protons exactly in the opposite direction and can thus be used for the alignment of the opposite arms of the experiment. Yet another advantage the protons have, by definition, zero momentum-loss and therefore, the dependence on the optics is largely reduced.

Reference to \Sc{al exp misal}.
As it follows from \Sc{rp measurement}, only the rotation around $z$ axis is relevant.

\section[al exp misal]{Expected misalignments}

Let's first asses what may go wrong and what are the corresponding misalignment estimates.

\noindent\em{Internal misalignments} arise from finite precision of fixing the detectors within a package. The precision is estimated to be
\eqref{20\un{\mu m}\ .}{internal misalignment shift}
This also gives estimate about the rotation
\eqref{\De\rh \approx {2\cdot 20\un{\mu m}\over 4\un{cm}} = 1\un{mrad}\ .}{internal misalignment rotation}

\noindent\em{Errors in RP positions}
\> z shifts
\> errors in RP motor control $~20\un{\mu m}$
\> RP frame deformation ???

\noindent\em{Errors in optical functions} are also sort of misalignments -- global alignment

\section[al collim]{Collimation alignment}

PUT THIS TO INTRODUCTION? In principle both \abb{BPM}s and \abb{RP} motor controls should have been calibrated such that they give the position of beam/RP edge with respect to the beam-pipe center. However, a cross-check is always good. Moreover, this exercise was needed for the alignment against the system of the LHC collimators.

In the beginning, the collimators scrape the beam such that its edge is sharp and its size and center is well defined. Then a RP is approached to the beam, until it touches the sharp edge. In this moment, particles from the beam edge are scattered off the RP edge and they give raise to peaks in the BLMs downstream (see \Fg{al collim ex} bottom). In this moment, the RP edge is at the same beam-sigma-distance as the collimators.

With the vertical RPs we can make use of the fact that we have two jaws and determine the beam-sigma (in millimeters) and the beam-center. Suppose that we have touched the beam with the top RP. In that moment, the RP became the primary collimator and scraped the beam a bit. Due to the multi-turn effect, the beam was scraped symmetrically about the vertical center of the beam. Then, one can approach the bottom pot, again until a BLM peak appears. Then, both RPs are at the same distance from the vertical beam-center and the distance corresponds to one beam-sigma (up to the step-size, indeed). These steps can be repeated in order to improve the precision of the beam-center determination. An example of this procedure can be found in \Fg{al collim ex}.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_collim_ex.pdf}{al collim ex}{An example of collimation alignment data from 29 November 2009 (56-220-near unit). The top and bottom pot movements (upper plot) induced the BLM signals (bottom plot). The time is in minutes from the start of the test.}

The precision is obviously given by the step size. Mostly because of the limited time resolution one cannot determine when during the movement the beam was touched. One should, thus, aim at as little steps as possible. On the other hand, the smaller step, the less scraping and the lower peak in the BLM signal. If the step is too small, the induced beam loss can not be distinguished from the noise. We observed a step of $50\un{\mu m}$ to be on the practical limit.

So far, the collimation alignment has been repeated three times: 29 November 2009, 25 June 2010 (both at $450\un{GeV}$) and 21 September 2010 at $3.5\un{TeV}$. The results suggest an unfortunate conclusion -- both RP LVDTs and BPMs seemed wrongly calibrated. For an immediate indication, let's look back to \Fg{al collim ex}. Assuming the beam was touched in the middle of the movement, one obtains the beam center at $(313\pm 63)\un{\mu m}$ according to the LVDTs. However, the corresponding BPM claimed the beam to be at $(-550\pm50)\un{\mu m}$. The discrepancy is evident, what is not clear is, however, which device to blame.

Very soon it became clear that the BPMs very not reliable at that time. A quite typical BPM curves are plotted in \Fg{al collim bpm problem}, note the huge drifts. It was confirmed by BPM experts that these devices suffered from temperature and intensity effects. These made the use of BPMs uninteresting for alignment purposes.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_collim_bpm_problem.pdf}{al collim bpm problem}{The readings from sector 56 BPMs from 25 June 2010. Very pronounced drifts are evident.}

Another valuable hint was provided later by the track-based alignment method (\Sc{al tb}). The results contained large per-RP shifts (i.e. all sensors from a pot indicated the same shift), moreover almost run-independent. This suggested that the LVDT scales did not have a common origin, in other words, every LVDT reading should be corrected by an offset. 

These offsets can be determined with the collimation alignment -- the principle is shown in \Fg{al collim}. The beam size at the collimator location ($n\si_0$) is known and can be propagated to the RP location, thus $n\si$ is known too. $t$ and $b$ are the top and bottom LVDT readings. The offsets then follow:
\eqref{o_t = n\si - t,\qquad o_b = -n\si - b\ .}{LVDT offsets}
Note that the offsets are determined with respect to the beam center (not the beam-pipe center), which is, in fact, exactly what we need. The measurements were performed on 21 Sep, the results were published in \bref{al collim} (Tb.~1). The calculated offsets can be found in \Tb{al lvdt off}. The error is dominated by the touching-point determination. Taking a half of the step size yields an error of $\approx 100\un{\mu m}$.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_collim.pdf}{al collim}{How to determine LVDT offsets with collimation alignment. The beam is drawn in blue, its envelope with solid and its center with dash-dotted line. The origins of the LVDT scales are marked with red dots.}

}

In this way, we've determined the vertical positions of the thin windows (the RP parts that face the beam, see \Sc{rp system}). The package with silicon sensors is inserted into the RP with a limited precision, which has even deteriorated by \TODO{the short-circuit incident}. Regarding the thin-window-to-sensor-edge distance, this may bring another $100\un{\mu m}$ of uncertainty. Thus, altogether, the vertical position of the sensors in the vertical pots is determined with a precision of $\approx 150\un{\mu m}$.

\section[al tb]{Track--based alignment}

\> Intro, partially the same as above: tracks should be straight lines, misalignments move the hits slightly off the track. They can be determined by an appropriate analysis of the residuals. \TODO{define residuals}

\> The basic structures in the track-based alignment are the detectors (sensors). Only these provide measurements and only these can be aligned.

\subsection[al psi]{The relation between proton kinimatics and RP measurements}

Since the magnetic field within RP stations is negligible, protons follow a straight trajectory, as drawn in the side view of \Fg{al proton sensor interaction} (the same is shown in \Fg{ttm proton transport}, but with the third axis called $s$). The track can be described
\eqref{\pmatrix{x\cr y\cr z} = \pmatrix{a_x\cr a_y\cr 1} z + \pmatrix{b_x\cr b_y\cr 0}\ ,}{al local track}
where $a$ and $b$ parameters give the track slopes and intercepts.

When a proton enters the sensitive volume of a silicon sensor, it creates electron-hole pairs along its trajectory. This charge is collected by neighbouring strips, giving raise to measurable signal. While details of this charge sharing process can be found, for example, in Sec.~7.4~in \bref{hubert}, here, we will assume that just the nearest strips is active (drawn in green in the front view of \Fg{al proton sensor interaction}). It is a reasonable assumption for the TOTEM sensors. Then, the measurement outcome $m$ can be written
\eqref{m = v + \De m\ ,}{al measurement}
where $v$ gives the projection of the hit point in the $\vec v$ direction (i.e. the read-out direction). $\De m$ is the \em{resolution error}, that is the error made by rounding $v$ to the nearest strip position.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_proton_sensor_interaction.pdf}{al proton sensor interaction}{A scheme of a proton interaction with a sensor. Left (side view when $\rh_y = 0$): the thick black line represents a sensor, the blue line a proton track. The blue dot marks the point where the proton hits the sensor. It has the same meaning in the right (front view) figure. There, the thick blue line shows the hit point projection into the read-out ($\vec v$) direction. The strip drawn in green is the active strip, the resolution error is drawn in red.}

The value of $v$ can be related to the track parameters with the aid of a transformation from (global) coordinate system $xyz$ to (local) system $uvz'$. The transformation can be written as follows
\eqref{\pmatrix{u\cr v\cr z'} = \mat R \left[ \pmatrix{x\cr y\cr z}  - \pmatrix{c_x\cr c_y\cr c_z}  \right] \ .}{al global to local}
The $c$ parameters give the position of sensor's center, the rotation $\mat R$ can be parameterized with three angles $\rh_{x,y,z}$:
\eqref{\mat R =
	\pmatrix{
		\cos\rh_z  & \sin\rh_z & 0\cr
		-\sin\rh_z & \cos\rh_z & 0\cr
		0		   & 0         & 1\cr
	}
	\pmatrix{
		\cos\rh_y  & 0 & \sin\rh_y\cr
		0		   & 1 &          \cr
		-\sin\rh_y & 0 & \cos\rh_y\cr
	}
	\pmatrix{
		1 & 0		   & 0        \cr
		0 & \cos\rh_x  & \sin\rh_x\cr
		0 & -\sin\rh_x & \cos\rh_x\cr
	}\ .
}{al rotation parameterization}
This three shifts and three rotations reflect the position of a sensor in the global coordinate frame. In reality, despite our best efforts, the position can not be exactly the nominal one. It is therefore important to distinguish between \em{true/actual} (with primes) and \em{nominal/thought} (without primes) position parameters:
\eqref{\rh_i' = \rh_i + \De\rh_i\ ,\qquad c_i' = c_i + \De c_i\ ,}{al misalignments}
where $\De\rh_i$ and $\De c_i$ represent the \em{misalignment} or, on the other hand, \em{alignment corrections}.

The nominal sensors' positions (see \Sc{ttm}) are perpendicular to the $z$ axis, that is $\rh_x=\rh_y=0$. The order angular misalignments $\De\rh$ in summarized in \Tb{al exp misal}. Taking $5\un{mrad}$ as the order of these angles, one obtains
\eqref{\cos\rh_{x,y}' = 1 + \O{10^{-5}},\qquad \sin\rh_{x,y}' = \rh_{x,y}' + \O{2\cdot 10^{-8}}}{al small rotation approximation}
and thus it is a good approximation to take just the lowest terms in the Taylor expansion. A similar statement holds for $\rh_z'$ too, just the expansion shall be made at the nominal value $\rh_z$.

The fact that the track \Eq{al local track} hits a sensor can be expressed as $z' = 0$. Then it is straightforward to calculate the $v$ coordinate of the hit:
\eqref{v =
	\Bigg[
		\underbrace{\pmatrix{-\sin\rh_z\cr\cos\rh_z}}_{\vec d}
		+ \underbrace{\pmatrix{-\cos\rh_z\cr -\sin\rh_z}}_{\vec d_\perp} \De\rh_z
	\Bigg]^\T
	\Bigg[
		\underbrace{\pmatrix{a_x\cr a_y}}_{\vec a} (c_z + \De c_z)
		 + \underbrace{\pmatrix{b_x\cr b_y}}_{\vec b}
		 - \underbrace{\pmatrix{c_x\cr c_y}}_{\vec c}
		 - \underbrace{\pmatrix{\De c_x\cr \De c_y}}_{\De \vec c}
	\Bigg]^\T
	+ \O{10^{-7}\un{m}}\ .
}{al hit v}
In fact, we have displayed just the most important terms, the others are included in the $\cal O$ factor. The separation follows from the following order estimates: $c_z \sim 1\un{m}$ (distances between pots in a station), $(b - c)_{x, y} \sim 10^{-2}\un{m}$ (size of the sensors) and $a_{x, y} \sim 10^{-2}\un{rad}$ (the maximal angle that can be detected by near and far units simultaneously). The last estimate is rather an upper bound, see the typical track angles in \Tb{al lhc datasets}. Thus for realistic data the neglected terms would be rather $\O{10^{-8}\un{m}}$.

In \Eq{al hit v} we have defined the \em{unit} vector $\vec d$ which represents the (nominal/thought) \em{read-out direction}. The vector $\vec d_\perp$ is perpendicular to the read-out direction, see \Fg{al proton sensor interaction}. The terms if the left-hand bracket represent the true/actual read-out direction. The vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$, $\vec c$ and $\De \vec c$ represent two-dimensional vectors of the track slope, the track intercept, sensor's center and the sensor's position misalignment.

The only rotation misalignment that has survived in \Eq{al hit v} is the one about the $z$ axis. Also, this is the only rotation which has non-zero nominal value. To simplify the notation, we will drop the $z$ subscripts in what follows:
$$\rh_z \longrightarrow \rh\ ,\qquad \De\rh_z \longrightarrow \De\rh\ .$$

So far we have considered one sensor and one event. But \Eq{al measurement,al hit v} can be written for any event and any sensor, for $i$-th sensor and $n$-th event they read
\eqref{
m_i^n = (\vec d_i + \De\rh_i\,\vec d_{\perp i})^\T \left[\vec a^n (z_i + \De z_i) + \vec b^n - (\vec c_i + \De\vec c_i)\right] + \De m_i^n + \O{10^{-7}\un{m}}\ ,
}{al meas i n}
where for brevity reasons we have made a replacement
$$c_{z,i} \longrightarrow z_i\ ,\qquad \De c_{z,i} \longrightarrow \De z_i\ .$$

In what follows, we will drop the last two terms on the \rhs, they will be treat as an error, see \Sc{al err}. The first term can be expanded
\eqref{\eqnarray{
\mu_i^n \equiv m_i^n + \vec d_i^\T \vec c_i = & &\cr
& +\vec d_i^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n)&\qquad 10^{-2}\un{m}\cr
& -\vec d_i^\T \De\vec c_i&\qquad 10^{-5}\un{m}\cr
& +\vec d_i^\T \vec a^n \De z_i&\qquad 10^{-??}\un{m} \cr
& +\De \rh_i\ \vec d_{\perp i}^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i) &\qquad 10^{-5}\un{m} \cr
& +\De \rh_i\ \vec d_{\perp i}^\T (\vec a^n \De z_i - \De\vec c_i) &\qquad 10^{-8}\un{m}\ , \cr
}}{al effective measurement}
where we have introduced an \em{effective measurement}. It differs from the full one just by constant $\vec d^\T \vec c$ (projection of sensor's center to its read-out direction). From the order estimates (shown above on the right-hand side) it is clear that one may neglect the last term. This is an important result since the remaining terms are (at most) linear in the misalignment parameters $\De \vec c_i$, $\De z_i$ and $\De \rh_i$. Furthermore, one can split the contributions of a track measurement by a sensor at the nominal position and the effect of misalignments:
\eqref{\mu_i^n =
\underbrace{\vec d_i^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n)}_{\hbox{track}}
+
\underbrace{\sum_j \ga_{j, i}^n\ \ch_{j, i}}_{\hbox{misalignment corrections}}
\ .}{al effective measurement 2}
In the above relation we have unified the notation for all misalignment quantities $\ch_j$, which influence the measurement via their coefficients $\ga_j$, see the summary in \Tb{al alignment quantities}

\htab{al alignment quantities}{Alignment quantity classes and their coefficients.}{\bln

3 & \hbox{rotation around}z & \De\rh_i				& \vec d_{\perp i}^\T (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i)\cr\bln
}

From \Eq{al effective measurement} it is clear that the measurement is only sensitive to one component of the detector shift, in particular the \em{shift in the read-out direction}:
\eqref{\De s_i \equiv \vec d_i \cdot \De\vec c_i\ .}{al shr def}
Thus, this is the only shift component that can be determined by the track-based alignment on a sensor level. For a RP package both transverse shift components can be determined, see \Sc{al rp fac}.


\subsection[al sim fit]{Simultaneous fit of track and alignment parameters}

From \Eq{al effective measurement 2} we see that sensors' measurements depend on the track parameters $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ and misalignment parameters $\ch$. One might thus fit sensors' data from a sample of events with the parameterization \Eq{al effective measurement 2}. This would result in misalignment parameter estimates and, as a byproduct, estimates of the track parameters.

This idea was first implemented in Millepede (see \bref{millepede}). Here we use different notation as our work as been done independently.

In order to perform the fit, it is useful to switch into a matrix formalism. Let us put all effective measurements in $n$-th event into vector $\vec\mu^n$. Then \Eq{al effective measurement 2} can be recast into:
\eqref{\vec\mu^n =
	\underbrace{\mat\al^n \vec\ta^n}_{\hbox{track}}
	+
	\underbrace{\sum_j \mat\Ga_j^n \vec \ch_j}_{\hbox{misalignments}}
\ ,}{al vec mu}
where
\eqref{\vec\ta^n = (a_x^n, a_y^n, b_x^n, b_y^n)^\T}{al vec tau}
is the vector of the track parameters and 
\eqref{\mat \al^n = \pmatrix{
	\vdots		& \vdots		& \vdots	& \vdots \cr
	d_{ix} z_i	& d_{iy} z_i	& d_{ix}	& d_{iy} \cr
	\vdots		& \vdots		& \vdots	& \vdots \cr
}, \quad i\hbox{ goes through all sensors involved in }n\hbox{-th event.}}{al mat alpha}
The vector $\vec\ch_j$ groups all the misalignments of the $j$-th type for all sensors. The matrices $\mat\Ga_j^n$ contain the coefficients $\ga^n_{j,i}$ as introduced in \Eq{al effective measurement 2}.

Let us remark that starting with \Eq{al vec mu}, the superscripts are reserved for event numbers, while subscripts fro the misalignment quantity class (see \Tb{al alignment quantities}).

Now we may put the measurement from all events into one vector:
\eqref{\vec M = (\vec\mu^1, \vec\mu^2, \ldots)^\T}{al vec M}
and similarly for the track and misalignment parameters
\eqref{\vec P = (\vec\ta^1, \vec\ta^2, \ldots || \vec\ch_1, \vec\ch_2, \ldots)^\T\ .}{al vec P}
With this notation, relations of the type \Eq{al vec mu} can be written
\eqref{\vec M = \mat A \vec P\ ,\qquad
	\mat A = \pmatrix{
	\ddots & 		&		&\vrule	&\ddots	&				&\udots	\cr
		&\mat \al^n	&		&\vrule	&		& \mat\Ga_j^n	&	\cr
		&		& \ddots	&\vrule	&\udots	&				&\ddots	\cr
	}\ .
}{al effective measurement all}
The left-hand part of $\mat A$ matrix is block-diagonal (with matrices $\mat\al^n$ on the diagonal). The right-hand part is built from $\mat\Ga_j^n$ matrices, the index $n$ increases in top-down direction, the index $j$ in the left-right one.

This form of \Eq{al effective measurement all} is convenient for an application of the linear Least Squares method (see e.g. Sec.~6.6 in \bref{barlow}). The method gives the following prescription for the estimate of the parameter vector $\vec P$:
\eqref{\hat\vec P = (\mat A^\T \mat V^{-1} \mat A)^{-1} \mat A^\T \mat V^{-1}\,\vec M\.}{al P estimate exact}
We use the hat in $\hat\vec P$ to emphasize that it is an estimate. The $\mat V$ matrix is the covariance matrix for the measurements $\vec M$. Since the measurements from different events are independent (as random variables), $\mat V$ has a block-diagonal structure
\eqref{\mat V = \pmatrix{
\ddots	&			&			\cr
		& \mat V^n	&			\cr
		&			& \ddots	\cr
}\ ,}{al mat V}
where a block $\mat V^n$ represents the covariance matrix of measurements from the $n$-th event (see \Sc{al err} for more details).

Unfortunately, \Eq{al P estimate exact} can not be applied directly. The problem comes from the fact that the $\ga^n_{j,i}$ coefficients (see \Tb{al alignment quantities}), which are contained in $\mat\Ga_j^n$ and $\mat A$ matrices, depend on the track parameters. And these are unknown at the fit time. Instead, one may adopt an \em{iterative} approach and use track parameter estimates obtained via a model where all misalignments are neglected. This is basically using $\mat \al^n$ as fit matrix for $\vec \mu^n$ data. Let us denote $\mat\Ga$ and $\mat A$ matrices obtained in this way with tildas:
\eqref{\vec\ta \rightarrow \hat\vec\ta: \quad \mat\Ga \rightarrow \tilde\mat\Ga, \mat A \rightarrow \tilde\mat A\ .}{al tau linearization}
This step brings in a necessity for several iterations, we will discuss them in \Sc{al err}.

Now we would like to extract the vector of misalignment estimates $\hat\vec\ch = (\hat\vec\ch_1, \hat\vec\ch_2, \ldots)^\T$ from the full parameter vector $\hat\vec P$ (see \Eq{al vec P}). It can be done by a straightforward evaluation of the \rhs{} of \Eq{al P estimate exact}. The inverse of
\eqref{\tilde\mat A^\T \mat V^{-1}\tilde\mat A =
\pmatrix{
\ddots 	& 											& 		&\vrule &\ddots & 														& \udots\cr
	 	& {\mat\al^n}^\T \mat V^{n^{-1}} \mat\al^n	& 		&\vrule & 		& {\mat\al^n}^\T \mat V^{n^{-1}}{\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^n 			& 		\cr

}
\ .}{al mat ATA}
can be obtained (let us assume momentarily that the inverse exists) with the aid of the following block matrix inverse rule (see e.g.~Sc.~4.3.2 in \bref{barnett}):
\eqref{\pmatrix{

},\qquad \mat S = {\cal D} - {\cal C}{\cal A}^{-1}{\cal B}\ .}{al block inverse}
The matrix $\tilde\mat S$ can be written
\eqref{\tilde\mat S = \pmatrix{

			& \sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga_i}^{n^\T} \mat\si^n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^n 	& \cr
	\udots	& 																		& \ddots\cr
}\ ,}{al mat S}
where we have used
\eqref{\mat\si^n = \mat V^{n^{-1}} - \mat V^{n^{-1}} \mat\al^n({\mat\al^n}^\T \mat V^{n^{-1}} \mat\al^n)^{-1} \mat {\mat\al^n}^\T V^{n^{-1}}\ .}{al sigma n}
The second bit needed for \Eq{al P estimate exact} is
\eqref{\tilde\mat A^\T \mat V^{-1}\,\vec M = \pmatrix{

Putting all together yields

In fact, the elements of $\mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n$ vector are residuals for the $n$-track divided by the corresponding measurement uncertainty. We will call this ratio \em{normalized residuals} and denote $\vec r^n$. The \em{full residuals} will be denoted by $\vec R^n$:

\eqref{\mat\si^n\,\vec \mu^n \equiv \vec r^n = \mat V^{n^{-1}} \vec R^n\ .}{al vec R}

It is worth mentioning some properties of the $\mat\si^n$ matrix -- it is symmetric, singular\footnote{%
Each column of $\mat\al^n$ provides a non-trivial solution to $\mat\si^{n} \vec w = 0$ and thus $\mat\si^n$ is singular (see e.g.~theorem 1.5.3 in \bref{anton}).} and its product with $\mat V^n$ is idempotent
\eqref{
	\mat\si^{n^\T} = \mat\si^n\ ,\qquad
	\mat\si^{n} \mat\al^n = 0\ ,\qquad
	(\mat V^n \mat\si^n)^2 = \mat V^n \mat\si^n\ .
}{al prop sigma n}

Above, we have assumed that the $\mat S$ matrix is regular (and thus the matrix inversion in \Eq{al P estimate exact} can be performed). However, in \Sc{al sing modes} we will demonstrate the opposite -- this just reflects the fact that certain misalignment are inaccessible to the track-based alignment. Despite the deficiency, the result \Eq{al fit equation} is almost correct. An easy way to see it is to plug \Eq{al vec mu} to the definition of $\tilde\vec T$ in \Eq{al fit equation}, it yields
\eqref{\tilde\vec T =
\pmatrix{
	\vdots \cr
	\sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^{n^\T} \mat\si^n \vec\mu^n\cr
	\vdots \cr
}
=

	 & \sum_n {\tilde\mat\Ga}_j^{n^\T} \mat\si^n \mat\Ga_i^n\cr
	\udots & & \ddots \cr
}
\vec\ch_i
=
\bar\mat S \vec\ch
}{al exact fit equation}

The only difference between $\tilde\mat S$ in \Eq{al fit equation} and $\bar\mat S$ in \Eq{al exact fit equation} is that $\tilde\mat S$ contains both $\mat\Ga$ matrices with tildes (see \Eq{al mat S}). This difference represents the error we make by the simplification step \Eq{al tau linearization}. Since the expected misalignments are small, the difference between $\mat\Ga$ and $\tilde\mat\Ga$ shall be small too and it is reasonable to expect that the solution $\hat\vec\ch$ of \Eq{al fit equation} would be close to the actual misalignments $\vec\ch$. The error can be reduced by taking several iterations, it will be discussed in \Sc{al err}.

Let us close this section with a simple example -- let us consider only the shifts in the read-out direction and a data sample where all sensors are active in all events. In such a case the coefficients $\ga^n = -1$ (cf. \Tb{al alignment quantities}) and thus matrices $\mat\Ga^n = -1$. Note that the $\ga^n$ coefficients are independent of the track parameters $\vec a^n$ and $\vec b^n$. Thus there is no need for the simplification \Eq{al tau linearization}, which effectively means $\tilde\mat S = \bar\mat S$ and there is no difference between the exact fit equation \Eq{al exact fit equation} and the simplified one \Eq{al fit equation}. They can be written (here the indeces $i,j$ identify the sensors):
\eqref{\tilde\mat S \hat\vec\ch = \tilde\vec T\ , \quad
	\tilde\mat S = \pmatrix{
		\ddots	&						&\udots	\cr
				& \sum_n\mat\si^n_{ij}	&		\cr
		\udots	&						&\ddots	\cr
	}\ ,\quad
	\hat\vec\ch = \pmatrix{
		\vdots\cr
		\De \hat s_j\cr

	}\ ,\quad
	\tilde\vec T = \pmatrix{
		\vdots\cr
		\sum_n r^n_i\cr
		\vdots\cr
	}\ .
}{al fit eq ex}
Hence the $\tilde\vec T$ vector is given by the sum of the normalized residuals, the $\tilde\mat S$ embodies the relation between the residuals and the misalignment shifts $\De s_i$.

\subsection[al sing modes]{Singular and weak modes}

In the previous section we have derived the fit equation \Eq{al fit equation}. If the matrix $\mat S$ were regular, one could obtain the alignment parameters $\hat\vec\ch$ by means of matrix inversion. But let us look closer on the fit equation. Note that the sensors' measurements enter the \rhs{} in the form of residuals. That means that any misalignment mode that does not generate residuals can not be revealed by the track-based algorithm. These misalignment modes are those where the misalignments $\vec\ch_j$ can be compensated (keeping measurements $\vec\mu^n$ unchanged) by varying the track parameters $\vec\ta^n \to {\vec\ta '}^n$ (cf. \Eq{al vec mu}):
\eqref{\mat\al^n {\vec\ta}^n + \sum_j \mat\Ga_j^n \vec\ch_j = \vec\mu^n = \mat\al^n {\vec\ta'}^n\ .}{al tau chi equiv}
The $\mat\Ga$ matrices may depend on the track parameters (see \Tb{al alignment quantities}), writing that yields
\eqref{\sum_j \mat\Ga_j(\vec\ta^n)\, \vec\ch_j = \al^n\, (\underbrace{{\vec\ta'}^n - \vec\ta^n}_{\De\vec\ta^n})\ .}{al sm con}
If one can find a vector $\De\vec\ta^n$ for any set of track parameters $\vec\ta^n$, then from \Eq{al mat S} it follows
\eqref{
	\mat S \pmatrix{\vdots\cr \vec\ch_i\cr\vdots} = 
	\pmatrix{\vdots\cr \sum_n {\mat\Ga_i^n}^\T \mat\si^n \sum_j \mat\Ga_j^n\, \vec\ch_j \cr\vdots} =
	\pmatrix{\vdots\cr \sum_n {\mat\Ga_i^n}^\T \mat\si^n \mat \al^n\, \De\vec\ta^n \cr\vdots} = 0\ ,
}{al sm}
which is a direct consequence of \Eq{al prop sigma n}. This would mean that $\mat S$ is singular (see e.g.~theorem 1.5.3 in \bref{anton}), with $\vec\ch$ being an eigenvector corresponding to zero eigenvalue. This vector represents an misalignment mode that is not accessible to the track-based alignment. We will refer to such modes as \em{singular modes}.

Let us come back to \Eq{al sm con}. It is important is to find a $\De\vec\ta^n$ vector for any vector $\vec\ta^n$. No matter what the interpretation is for the latter one -- whether it is the vector of true or estimated track parameters, cf. \Eq{al tau linearization}. This is exactly what makes the difference between $\mat\Ga$ and $\tilde\mat\Ga$ and consequently among $\mat S$, $\bar\mat S$ and $\tilde\mat S$. And that is why the singular modes found in \Eq{al sm} are also singular modes for $\bar\mat S$ and $\tilde\mat S$ matrices.

Later, we will find useful to use the definition of the $\mat\al$ matrix \Eq{al mat alpha} and rewrite the \rhs{} of \Eq{al sm con} as
\eqref{\mat\al^n\, \De\vec\ta^n = \pmatrix{
	\vdots\cr
	\vec d_i \cdot (\De\vec a^n z_i + \De\vec b^n)\cr
	\vdots\cr
}, \quad i\hbox{ goes through all sensors involved in }n\hbox{-th event.}}{al sm track par}
The vectors $\De\vec a^n$ and $\De\vec b^n$ are merely an alternative description of the track-parameter variation $\De\vec\ta^n$, cf. \Eq{al vec tau}.

In the rest of this section we will identify all singular modes that may appear in the alignment of the RP sensors. We will first focus on the singular modes that arise from the interplay between the geometry of the detector apparatus and the geometry of the tracks. Afterwards we will turn our attention to the singular modes provoked by special (pathological) track distributions.

\caption{Geometrical singular modes}

In this part we will discuss the singular modes corresponding to each alignment quantity class, one by one. But prior to that, let us remark one characteristics of the RP sensors -- all of their nominal read-out directions are parallel (or anti-parallel) to either $U$ or $V$ axes (see \Sc{ttm}). This could be written as $\vec\d_i \in \{\pm U, \pm V\}$. We will consider a bit more general case, where the sensors, classified by their read-out directions, split into several \em{read-out groups}:
\eqref{\vec d_i \in \lbrace \pm\vec\de_1, \pm\vec\de_2, \ldots \rbrace \ ,
	%\qquad |\vec\de_i \cdot \vec\de_j| \neq 1\hbox{ for } i \neq j\ .
}{al read-out groups}
where the (non-collinear) vectors represent the read-out directions of each group. 

For \em{shifts in the read-out direction}, the condition \Eq{al sm con} reads (using \Eq{al sm track par})
\eqref{
	\De s_i \equiv
	\vec d_i \cdot \De\vec c_i =
	- \vec d_i \cdot ( \De\vec a^n z_i + \De\vec b^n )\ .
}{al sm shr sol}

Since the \lhs{} does not depend on the event number $n$, neither must the \rhs{}. That is why the ${\De\vec a}=(\De a_x, \De a_y)^\T$ and ${\De\vec b=(\De b_x, \De b_y)^\T}$ vectors do not need to carry a superscript. These two vectors define the structure of the singular modes -- they correspond to \em{global} ($\De\vec b$) and \em{linearly-progressive} ($\De\vec a\, z_i$) shifts in $x$ and $y$. By global shift we mean a shift that is common for all sensors. The size of a linearly-progressive shift is proportional to the $z$-position of a sensor. There are four free parameters, thereby four singular modes. The situation is illustrated in \Fg{al sing modes shr}.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_sing_modes_shr.pdf}{al sing modes shr}{An illustration of the singular modes \Eq{al sm shr sol}: a front view on a sensor package. Each sensor is represented by a dot (its center $\vec c$) and an arrow (its read-out direction $\vec d$), cf.~the front view in \Fg{al proton sensor interaction}. The hollow dots mark the nominal positions, the solid ones represent the misalignment mode. For simplicity we have considered a simplified package of six sensors only (see the numbers), moreover with an equal spacing $\De z$. The $U$ (red) and $V$ (blue) sensors are regularly alternating, the first one is at $z = 0$.}

\em{Shifts in $z$}. Writing the condition \Eq{al sm con} for each read-out group yields
\eqref{\vec\de_g \cdot \vec a^n \De z_i = \vec\de_g \cdot (
	\De\vec a^n\, z_i + \De\vec b^n
)\ ,\qquad\hbox{for sensors }i\hbox{ from group }g\ .}{al sm shz con grp}
Since this shall hold for all $\vec a^n$, the ratio $\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec a^n / \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n$ must be $n$-independent. On the other hand, it can be different for every group. Formally written (the treatment of the $\De\vec b^n$ term is identical):
\eqref{
{\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec a^n \over \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n} = \al_g\ ,\qquad
{\vec\de_g\cdot\De\vec b^n \over \vec\de_g\cdot\vec a^n} = \be_g\ .
}{al sm shz ratio}
The above relation determines what the $\De\vec a^n$ vector should be for a given track slope vector $\vec a^n$ and a set of $\al_g$ parameters. In fact, there is one such a relation per one read-out group. This should be compared to the rank of the $\De\vec a^n$ vector -- it is two-dimensional. That means that for one group only, that there is an infinite number of solutions ($\De\vec a^n$ vectors that fulfil \Eq{al sm shz ratio}). For two groups, there is one and unique solution. From \Eq{al sm shz con grp} one can read off the corresponding singular modes:
\eqref{\De z_i = \al_g z_i + \be_g\ ,\qquad\hbox{for sensors }i\hbox{ from group }g\ ,}{al sm shz sol 2g}
For more than two groups there is generally no solution (it is an over-constrained problem). However, if the $\al_g$ parameters are equal for all the read-out groups, the equation has a solution: $\De\vec a^n = \al \vec a^n$. It corresponds to singular modes:
\eqref{\De z_i = \al z_i + \be\ .}{al sm shz sol 3g}
In fact, these are just special cases of the singular modes \Eq{al sm shz sol 2g}, therefore they are present for any type of geometry (any number of read-out groups). Both types of the singular modes are illustrated in \Fg{al sing modes shz}, for a summary see \Tb{al sing mode overview}.

Each sensor is represented by a dot (its center $\vec c$) and an arrow (the $x$ projection of its read-out direction $\vec d$). The hollow dots mark the nominal positions, the solid ones represent the misalignment mode. For simplicity we have considered a simplified package of six sensors only (see the numbers), moreover with an equal spacing $\De z$. The first sensor is at $z = 0$.

}

\em{Rotations around $z$}. When applying the condition \Eq{al sm con} one shall keep both rotation and read-out-direction shift misalignments. It will turn out that they can not be separated. Written for each read-out group the condition reads:
\eqref{
	\De\rh_i\, \vec \de_{\perp_g} \cdot (\vec a^n z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i) =
	\vec\de_g \cdot (
		\De\vec a^n\, z_i +
		\De\vec b^n +
		\De\vec c_i
	)\ .
}{al sm rotz con}
In any realistic (non-pathological) geometry the vectors $(z_1, z_2, \ldots)^\T$, $(c_{x,1}, c_{x,2}, \ldots)^\T$, $(c_{y,1}, c_{y,2},\ldots)^\T$ and $(1, 1, \ldots)^\T$ are linearly independent. This means that the above condition can only be fulfilled if the coefficients to these vectors are equal on both sides of the equation:
\eqref{
	\De\rh_i\, \vec\de_{\perp_g} \cdot \vec a^n = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec a^n\ ,\qquad
	\De\rh_i\, \vec\de_{\perp_g} \cdot \vec b^n = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec b^n\ ,\qquad
	- \De\rh_i\, \vec\de_{\perp_g} \cdot \vec c_i = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec c_i\ .
}{al sm rotz con sep}
The first two relations require $\De\rh_i$ to be constant within every read-out group: $\De\rh_i \rightarrow \De\rh_g$. Moreover they are very similar to \Eq{al sm shz ratio} and so is the interpretation. For one group only there exists infinitely many solutions (vectors $\De\vec a^n$ and $\De\vec b^n$ that obey \Eq{al sm rotz con sep}). For two groups, there is exactly one solution. For more than two groups, the equation is, generally over-constrained and with no solution. The only exception occurs if $\De\rh_g$ is the same for all groups, then the equation is solved by $\De\vec a^n = \De\rh (-a^n_y, a^n_x)^\T$, etc.

The third relation in \Eq{al sm rotz con sep} gives the read-out-direction shift accompanying the rotation singular modes:
\eqref{\De s_i \equiv \vec d_i \cdot \De\vec c_i = - \De\rh_i\, \de s_i\ ,\qquad \de s_i = \vec d_{\perp_i} \cdot \vec c_i\ .}{al sm rotz shr}
The reason for this shift is that the singular mode is a rotation about the $z$ axis, but the alignment rotations are performed about sensors' centers, displaced by $\vec c_i$ from the $z$ axis.

The singular modes can then be summarized
\eqref{
\pmatrix{
	\De\rh_i \cr
	\De s_i
	}
= \De\rh_g \pmatrix{
	1\cr
	- \de s_i
}
\ .}{al sm rotz sol}
For three and more groups, $\De\rh$ is a constant, thus there is just one singular mode. For two groups, the values of $\De\rh_g$ are independent for each group, therefore there are two singular modes. The situation is illustrated in \Fg{al sing modes rotz}, a summary can be found in \Tb{al sing mode overview}.

The hollow dots and dashed arrows/lines show the nominal positions and read-out directions, the full dots and solid arrows represent the misalignment mode. For simplicity we have considered a simplified package of six sensors only (see the numbers), note that often they lie on top of each other in the drawing. Left: the case with two read-out groups, like in the nominal geometry, the $U$ (red) and $V$ (blue) sensors are alternating regularly.

}

To illustrate the structure of the singular modes we have made a number of MC studies. We have considered a series of geometries, starting with the nominal one and adding rotation misalignments to all sensors. These mis-rotations have been randomly generated according to a normal distribution with a variable variance. Going from zero variance to positive values represents a smooth transition from a geometry with two read-out groups to geometries with more groups. For certain alignment modes this means a transition from singular to non-singular state, see \Fg{al eig rho}.

A convenient way to visualize the structure of the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix is to plot its eigenspectrum. The singular modes are represented by zero eigenvalues, the modes accessible to the track-based alignment by non-zero values. In fact the eigenvalues have an important meaning for the alignment application. To unveil it, let us rewrite the fit equation \Eq{al fit equation} in ``eigen coordinates'' -- coordinates relative to an orthonormal set of $\tilde\mat S$ eigenvectors. Denoting $\mat Q$ a matrix containing this set as columns, one can write (see e.g.~Eq.(6.85) in \bref{barnett}):
\eqref{
	\mat D\, \hat\vec\ch^{\rm E} = \tilde\vec T^{\rm E}\ ,\qquad
	\hat\vec\ch^{\rm E} = \mat Q^\T \hat\vec\ch\ ,\qquad
	\tilde\vec T^{\rm E} = \mat Q^\T \tilde\vec T\ ,
}{al fit eq eigen}
where $\mat D$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues $\la$ of $\tilde\mat S$. The $\hat\vec\ch^{\rm E}$ and $\tilde\vec T^{\rm E}$ vectors are the vectors $\hat\vec\ch$ and $\tilde\vec T$ expressed in the ``eigen coordinates''. Since $\mat D$ is diagonal, the fit equation has a simple form, written for the $m$-th alignment mode:
\eqref{\hat\ch^{\rm E}_m = {\tilde T^{\rm E}_m\over \la_m} \longrightarrow {\tilde T^{\rm E}_m + \De\tilde T^{\rm E}_m \over \la_m}\ .}{al fit eq eigen one}
If $\la_m = 0$, the equation cannot be solved -- the mode $m$ is a singular mode. However one may expect troubles even if $\la_m$ is non-zero but small. One should keep in mind that the $\tilde T^{\rm E}$ is built from measurements, see \Eq{al fit equation}, and as such it is subject to an experimental error. Formally, this is expressed by adding the $\De\tilde T^{\rm E}_m$ term on the \rhs{} above. If $\la_m$ is small, the ratio $\De\tilde T^{\rm E}_m/\la_m$ may grow large, in other words $\hat\ch^{\rm E}_m$ can only be determined with a large uncertainty. In that sense, the eigenvalue $\la_m$ controls the determination power of the alignment mode $m$. If the eigenvalue is small, the determination is weak -- that is why we will call these modes \em{weak modes} in what follows. For a more complete discussion of the uncertainties, see \Sc{al err}.

Whereas the singular and weak modes are very different from the theoretical point of view, they look the same for computer programs. Any numerical calculation of eigenvalues has a limited accuracy (we have used ROOT matrix libraries \bref{root matrix} at double precision). Therefore the eigenvalues corresponding to singular modes are found small but non-zero. In order to distinguish between regular and singular (or very weak) modes one thus needs to set a finite \em{singular limit}. \Fg{al eig rho} shows that a value of $10^{-9}$ is reasonable.

It reasonable to expect that the eigenvalues of $\tilde\mat S$ would be proportional to the number of events $N_{\rm events}$. To have results event-number independent, it makes sense to define \em{normalized eigenvalues}:
\eqref{\la_{\rm N} = \hbox{eigenvalue of }\tilde\mat S/N_{\rm events}\ ,}{al S norm eig val}
which are used in \Fg{al eig rho}.


\fig{fig/pdf/al_eigenvalues_rho.pdf}{al eig rho}{\TODO{correct eq numbers}. The spectrum of normalized eigenvalues of the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix ($\la_{\rm N}$) as a function of geometry. The geometries considered have been created from the nominal one-station geometry by applying rotation misalignment to each sensor. The misalignments have been randomly generated according to a normal distribution with zero mean and variance $\si^2_\rh$ -- the quantity on the horizontal axis. The case $\si_\rh = 0$ corresponds to the nominal geometry, which contains two read-out groups. Increasing $\si_\rh$ then represents a smooth transition to configurations with three and more read-out groups.
The colors correspond to the eigenvalue order (bottom-top). Therefore, when two curves representing two alignment modes cross, they exchange their colors (e.g. the mode (4.47) in the bottom plot).

\caption{Pathological track distributions}

Besides the singular modes derived above, there could be singular modes arising from special track distributions. One could immediately think of a case where the sensors split into several groups such that no track can go through sensors of different groups at a time. Regarding RPs, this situation may appear when the pots are not inserted close enough and therefore no track can go through the overlap between the vertical and horizontal pots. In this case, the alignment task would split into several smaller tasks (one per group) and for each of them one could write an alignment equation like \Eq{al fit equation}. Each of these equations contains a $\tilde\mat S$ matrix with its singular modes as discussed above. Therefore the number of singular modes gets multiplied by the number of groups.

The LHC proton tracks are very parallel (see e.g. \Tb{al lhc datasets}). In other words the distribution of the track slopes $\vec a^n$ is peaked about a mean value $\bar\vec a$ with a spread (in either projection)
\eqref{\si_a = \O{10^{-4}\un{rad}}\ .}{al sm a dist}
Let us reexamine the condition for rotation singular modes \Eq{al sm rotz con} when the spread $\si_a\to 0$:
\eqref{
	\De\rh_i\, \vec \de_{\perp_g} \cdot (\bar\vec a z_i + \vec b^n - \vec c_i) =
	\vec\de_g \cdot (
		\De\vec a^n\, z_i +
		\De\vec b^n +
		\De\vec c_i
	)\ .
}{al sm rotz con la}
Again, we will compare the coefficients to the vectors vectors $(z_1, z_2, \ldots)^\T$, $(c_{x,1}, c_{x,2}, \ldots)^\T$, $(c_{y,1}, c_{y,2},\ldots)^\T$ and $(1, 1, \ldots)^\T$ on both sides. For \Eq{al sm rotz con} there was only one way to do it, here is another one. It comes from the fact that $\bar\vec a z_i$ term is not $n$-dependent. Therefore it can be absorbed into the $\De\vec c_i$ term on the \rhs Then, $\vec b^n$ can be linked to $\De\vec a^n$, this requires $\De\rh_i$ to be proportional to $z_i$. Denoting $\al_i$ the proportionality constant, the condition splits into three:

\eqref{
	\al_i\, \vec\de_{\perp_g} \cdot \vec b^n = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec a^n\ ,\qquad
	0 = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec b^n\ ,\qquad
	\al_i z_i\, \vec\de_{\perp_g} \cdot (\bar\vec a - \vec c_i) = \vec\de_g \cdot \De\vec c_i\ .
}{al sm rotz con sep la}
The first relation is very similar to the first one from \Eq{al sm rotz con sep} and so the interpretation is. First, the proportionality constant must be constant within each read-out group: $\al_i\to \al_g$. Second, for one group only, there are infinitely many solutions $\vec\De a^n$ for every $\vec b^n$. For two groups, there is exactly one solution. For three and more groups the problem is generally over-constrained, having a solution only if $\al_g$ is the same for all the read-out groups.

The third relation in \Eq{al sm rotz con sep la} determines the read-out-direction shift that accompanies the rotation singular modes. They can be summarized:
\eqref{
\pmatrix{
	\De\rh_i \cr
	\De s_i
	}
= \al_g z_i \pmatrix{
	1\cr
	\vec d_{\perp_i} \cdot (\bar\vec a - c_i)
}
\ .}{al sm rotz sol la}
For two groups, the $\al_g$ parameters are independent for both groups. There are thus two more singular modes. For three and more groups, the values of $\al_g$ must be the same for all groups, therefore there is just one new singular mode.

Note that the $\De s_i$ part of the rotation singular vectors \Eq{al sm rotz sol,al sm rotz sol la} can be compensated by the read-out-direction shift singular modes \Eq{al sm shr sol}. It is therefore sufficient to consider the rotation singular modes in a form:
\eqref{\De\rh_i = \al_g z_i + \be_g\ .}{al sm rotz full sol}
$\be_g$ (equivalent of $\De\rh_g$ in \Eq{al sm rotz sol}) represents a global rotation, $\al_g$ leads to a linearly-progressive rotation.

}

Unlike the geometrical singular modes, the modes \Eq{al sm rotz sol la} are singular for $\mat S$ and $\bar\mat S$ only, not for $\tilde\mat S$. The reason is that the transition \Eq{al tau linearization} from true to estimated track parameters brings in an experimental error (finite resolution of the sensors and their misalignment). Thus even if the true tracks were perfectly parallel, the reconstructed ones would be not. Consequently the modes \Eq{al sm rotz sol la} correspond only to small, but non-zero eigenvalues of $\tilde\mat S$ -- they are weak modes.

\Fg{al eig theta} shows a transition from almost parallel (low $\si_a$) to non-parallel tracks (high $\si_a$). There are two alignment modes very sensitive to the track angular spread $\si_a$ -- see the labelled blue and red curves. Regarding the $\mat S$ matrix (left panel), these modes become singular in the parallel limit $\si_a \to 0$. Not so for the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix (right panel). The eigenvalues stop reducing at about $\si_a\approx 1\un{\mu rad}$, which compares well to the angular resolution of a station. This saturation demonstrates the effect discussed in the previous paragraph. A similar saturation takes place (in both panels) at the high-$\si_a$ end. It starts about $\si_a \approx 10\un{mrad}$, which corresponds well to the maximal angle which can be detected by both near and far units. Thus tracks with higher angles can not contribute to an alignment of a station.

It would be possible to draw a similar line of arguments for a situation where $\vec b^n\to \bar\vec b = $ const. But keeping in mind the application to LHC proton tracks, this turns out to be very unrealistic scenario.

At the end, let us remark that parallel tracks do not introduce new weak modes for the shifts in the read-out directions. The corresponding singular mode condition \Eq{al sm shr sol} is completely independent of the track slopes $\vec a^n$, therefore their vanishing spread makes no difference. Regarding the shifts in $z$, it makes little sense to consider the case of parallel tracks -- there the $z$-shifts can not be determined at all. The singular and weak modes for all considered configurations are summarized in \Tb{al sing mode overview}.

\subsection[al constr]{Constraints}

In the previous section we have shown that the $\tilde\mat S$ is singular, which expresses the fact that some alignment modes are inaccessible to the track-based alignment. To accomplish the alignment task -- to solve the \Eq{al fit equation} -- one thus needs to supply the information about the inaccessible (singular) modes from another source. This information may be formulated in a form of additional \em{constraints} (to the alignment solution $\hat\vec\ch$) which compensates the singularity of the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix. We will consider a set of linear constraints

\eqref{
	\mat C^\T \hat\vec\ch = \vec V\ ,\qquad
	\mat C = \pmatrix{
		\vdots\cr
		\vec c_i^\T\cr
		\vdots\cr
	}\ ,\qquad
	\vec V = \pmatrix{
		\vdots\cr
		v_i\cr
		\vdots\cr
	}
\ ,}{al constraints}
where $\vec c_i$ and $v_i$ are the constraint vectors and values ($i$ enumerates the constraints). The constraints require that the ``projection'' of the solution $\hat\vec\ch$ to the ``direction'' $\vec c_i$ is $v_i$. We have used the quotes since we do not require the vectors $\vec c_i$ to be of unit size. Still we find this interpretation of the constraints quite intuitive.

The fit equation \Eq{al fit equation} has been derived by pursuing a least squares fit (simultaneously for misalignment and track parameters, see \Sc{al sim fit}). Now introducing the constraints, we have to deal with a constrained least squares problem. It can be addressed by the Lagrange-multipliers technique (see e.g.~\bref{Millepede}):
\eqref{
	\pmatrix{
		\tilde\mat S & \mat C \cr
		\mat C^\T & 0\cr
	}
	\pmatrix{
		\hat\vec\ch \cr
		\vec\La \cr
	}
	=
	\pmatrix{
		\tilde\vec T\cr
		\vec V\cr
	}
\ ,}{al alignment equation}
where $\vec\La$ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers. The bottom row expands to the constraints requirement \Eq{al constraints}. Expanding the upper row yields the fit equation \Eq{al fit equation} with a small modification:
\eqref{
	\tilde\mat S \hat\vec\ch = \vec T' \equiv \tilde\vec T - \mat C \vec\La\ .
}{al mod fit eq}
The presence of the Lagrange multiplier term can guarantee the existence of a solution for any $\tilde\vec T$.

The $\tilde\mat S$ matrix is symmetric and thus, according to theorem 7.3.1 in \bref{anton}, it can be diagonalized by $\tilde\mat S = \mat Q \mat D \mat Q^\T$. The columns of the $\mat Q$ matrix form an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of $\tilde\mat S$, with the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal of the $\mat D$ matrix (which is thus diagonal). Moreover we can order the eigenvectors such that the first columns in $\mat Q$ correspond to zero eigenvalue. We will denote this part $\mat Q_{\rm s}$, the other eigenvectors form the $\mat Q_{\rm r}$ sub-matrix. Denoting $\mat L$ the matrix containing all non-zero eigenvalues on the diagonal, one can write
\eqref{\tilde\mat S = (\mat Q_{\rm s}, \mat Q_{\rm r})
	\pmatrix{0& 0\cr 0& \mat L\cr}
	\pmatrix{\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T\cr \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T}\ ,
}{al S diag}
Applying this decomposition to \Eq{al mod fit eq} yields
\eqref{
	\pmatrix{0 & 0 \cr 0 & \mat L\cr} \pmatrix{\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T\cr \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T} \hat\vec\ch
	= \pmatrix{\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T\cr \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T} \vec T'
}{al mod fit eq eig}
Since the upper row is identically zero on the \lhs, so must be on the \rhs., thereby
\eqref{
	\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \tilde\vec T = \mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \mat C\vec\La\ .
}{al T no sing cont}
Note that it would not be possible to fulfill this condition without the Lagrange multipliers. In order to find a vector $\vec\La$ for any vector $\tilde\vec T$, one gets a requirement on the set of constraints:
\eqref{\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \mat C\hbox{ must be regular}\ .}{al ETC reg}
Then
\eqref{\vec\La = (\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \mat C)^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \tilde\vec T\ .}{al cnst La}

The \Eq{al mod fit eq eig} sets no requirements on $\mat Q_{s}^\T \hat\vec\ch \equiv \vec\ch_{\rm s}$, but it requires $\mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \hat\vec\ch = \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \vec T'$. Therefor every solution of \Eq{al mod fit eq eig} can be written
\eqref{\hat\vec\ch =  \mat Q_{\rm r} \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \vec T' + \mat Q_{\rm s} \vec\ch_{\rm s}\ ,}{al sol param}
which corresponds to the standard form with a particular solution (first term) and a parameterization of solutions of the homogeneous equation $\tilde\mat S \vec\ch_{\rm s} = 0$ (second term), see theorem 5.5.2~in \bref{anton}. The matrix in the first term could be interpreted as the inversion of the non-singular part of the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix.

Another requirement we want to imply on the set of constraints $\mat C$ is to determine the solution $\hat\vec\ch$ uniquely. By inserting the above parameterization to \Eq{al constraints}, one finds that the requirement is equivalent to asking $\mat C^\T \mat Q_{\rm s}$ to be regular. This is further equivalent to the previous requirement \Eq{al ETC reg}. Then, the homogeneous-equation solution $\vec\ch_{\rm s}$ is fixed to
\eqref{\vec\ch_{\rm s} = (\mat C^\T \mat Q_{\rm s})^{-1} (\vec V - \vec C^\T \mat Q_{\rm r} \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \vec T')\ .}{al cnst chi s}

Putting altogether yields
\eqref{\hat\vec\ch =
	\mat P^\T \mat Q_{\rm r} \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \mat P \tilde\vec T
	+ \mat Q_{\rm s} (\mat C^\T \mat Q_{\rm s})^{-1} \vec V\ ,\qquad
	\mat P = 1 - \mat C (\mat Q_{\rm s}^\T \mat C)^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm s}^\T\ .
}{al cnst sol}
It will be the starting point for discussing the alignment uncertainty in \Sc{al err}.

\iffalse
If we neglect the experimental errors that enter the $\tilde\vec T$ vector, it can be calculated from \Eq{al exact fit equation}: $\tilde\vec T = \bar\mat S \vec\ch$. We recall that $\vec\ch$ is the vector of true (not estimated) residuals. As the singular modes of $\tilde\mat S$ and $\bar\mat S$ are the same, one finds that $\bar\mat S E = 0$ too. Consequently, \Eq{al T no sing cont} leads to $\La = 0$. If the experimental errors are not neglected, the relation becomes only approximative: $\La \approx 0$. This provides a consistency check that may be used during real data analysis.
\fi

So far we have focused on constraining the singular modes. Looking back to \Eq{al fit eq eigen one} we remind that there might be also weak modes, which would still allow for a solution, however they would severely deteriorate the accuracy. In such a situation, one might want to constrain some of the weak modes too. In principle, the alignment equation \Eq{al alignment equation} still may be used. But since the number of constraints and the number of singular modes is different now, the results \Eq{al ETC reg} and onwards can not be applied. A discussion on a general level would be complicated, let us focus on a practical case instead.

As already mentioned, singular modes look like weak to any computer program (due to limited calculation accuracy their eigenvalues are not exactly zero). In such a situation, the $\tilde\mat S$ matrix is not singular, but has a number of weak modes that need to be constrained. Then two important results can be derived for the solution of \Eq{al alignment equation} \footnote{%
The derivation is lengthy, here we just sketch the main steps. Since $\tilde\mat S$ is regular now, the solution of \Eq{al alignment equation} can be written
$$
	\hat\vec\ch = \tilde\mat S^{-1} \big[ 1 - \mat C \mat M \mat C^\T \tilde\mat S^{-1} \big]
		+ \tilde\mat S^{-1} \mat C \mat M \vec V\ ,\qquad
	\mat M = (\mat C^\T \tilde\mat S^{-1} \mat C)^{-1}\ .
$$
In order to evaluate the $\mat M$ matrix, one may employ a diagonalization similar to \Eq{al S diag}. With the only exception that $\tilde\mat S$ has weak and regular modes now: $\mat Q = (\mat Q_{\rm w}, \mat Q_{\rm r})$ and $\mat D = \diag(\mat l, \mat L)$. The matrices $\mat l$ and $\mat L$ are diagonal and contain the weak and regular eigenvalues respectively. Using the diagonalization, one finds that $\mat M^{-1}$ receives two contributions -- from weak and regular modes:
$$ \mat M = \big[
	(\mat Q_{\rm w}^\T \mat C)^\T \mat l^{-1} (\mat Q_{\rm w}^\T \mat C)
	+ (\mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \mat C)^\T \mat L^{-1} (\mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \mat C)
\big]^{-1}\ .$$
Since $\mat l$ contains the weak eigenvalues, which are small, the first term is dominating. To perform the inversion, one may use the recurrent relation:
$$(\mat A+\mat B)^{-1} = \mat A^{-1} - \mat A^{-1} \mat B \mat A^{-1} + \mat A^{-1} \mat B \mat A^{-1} \mat B \mat A^{-1} \ldots\ ,$$
identifying $\mat A$ with the first term. Since each $\mat A$ contains a $\mat l$ factor, the above expansion represents a sort of power series. Then it is just a matter of some algebra to obtain this type of power expansion for the solution $\hat\vec\ch$. Provided that $\mat Q_{\rm w}^\T \mat C$ is regular, the expansion involves non-negative powers of $\mat l$ only. Thus, it is finite in the limit $\mat l\to 0$. Moreover, in this limit, the solution gains the form of \Eq{al cnst sol}.
}.
First, the weak modes are constrained if
\eqref{\mat Q_{\rm w}^\T \mat C \hbox{ is regular} \ .}{al WTC reg}
Similarly to the definition of $\mat Q_{\rm s}$, the $\mat Q_{\rm w}$ matrix contains the weak modes as columns.
Second, in the limit where the weak modes become singular (their eigenvalues tend to zero), the solution becomes equivalent to \Eq{al cnst sol}. Hence there is no difference between extremely weak and singular modes. This is important since computer programs treat singular modes as weak.

We have seen that a set of constraints must fulfill certain conditions, see \Eq{al ETC reg,al WTC reg}, but one has still a lot of freedom in their choice. Let us list a few common options.

\> Probably the most natural choice is to take the singular modes as the constraints, that is $\mat C = \mat Q_{\rm s}$. We will refer to this option as \em{homogeneous constraints} (the role of all detectors is equal, in contrary to the next options). In principle, this set of constraints may be extended by the weak modes, then $\mat C = (\mat Q_{\rm s}, \mat Q_{\rm w})$.
\par\parindent\itindent\indent\hang As an example, we write explicitly the constraint matrix $\mat C$ for the read-out-direction shifts only. Taking the singular modes from \Eq{al sm shr sol}, the matrix can read
\eqref{\mat C = \pmatrix{
	\vdots		& \vdots		& \vdots	& \vdots \cr
	d_{ix} z_i	& d_{iy} z_i	& d_{ix}	& d_{iy} \cr
	\vdots		& \vdots		& \vdots	& \vdots \cr
}\ ,\qquad i\hbox{ going through all detectors.}}{al hom cnst ex}

\> Another natural choice is to select a subset of reference sensors, fix their positions and let the other sensors align with respect to the reference ones. We will call this option \em{fixed-sensors constraints}. Both singular and weak modes can be constrained in this way.
\par\parindent\itindent\indent\hang For an example, we consider again the case with read-out-direction shifts only. There we face four singular modes, thus we need to fix the positions of four detectors, let us take first two and last two:
\eqref{\mat C = \pmatrix{
	1		& 0			& 0 		& 0 		\cr
	0		& 1			& 0 		& 0 		\cr
	\vdots	& \vdots	& \vdots	& \vdots	\cr
	0		& 0			& 1 		& 0 		\cr
	0		& 0			& 0 		& 1 		\cr
}\ .}{al fix-det cnst ex}

\> The last option is called \em{final constraints} since it has been used for the final alignment analysis (and the elastic scattering analysis presented in \Sc{felm}). In the \Sc{al mc tests} we will show the shifts in $z$ can not be resolved with a satisfactory precision (see \Fg{al err shz theta}). That is why they have been dropped from the alignment procedure. As shown in \Fg{al err rotz rho,al err rotz theta}, the rotation between $U$ and $V$ sensors and between far and near units can only be determined with a large uncertainty. It is thus necessary to constrain these two additional weak modes, increasing the number of rotation constraints to four (cf. \Tb{al sing mode overview}). The final constraints require zero mean rotation $\De\rh$, separately for $U$ and $V$ sensors and separately for each unit.
\par\parindent\itindent\indent\hang
The read-out-direction shift constraints are similar to those from the homogeneous-constraints set. With the exception that the horizontal pots are not included in the constraints. The reason is that we trust the beam position determination by the collimation alignment (see \Sc{al collim}) and therefore we want to preserve the vertical center between the top and bottom pots. This is achieved by asking no mean shift of the top and bottom pot.
\par\parindent\itindent\indent\hang
To summarize, for every unit, these four constraints are imposed:
\eqref{\eqnarray{
\hbox{shifts:}\qquad && \sum_{i\ \in\ \hbox{top, bottom}} \De s_i \, d_{x_i} = \sum_{i\ \in\ \hbox{top, bottom}} \De s_i \, d_{y_i} = 0\ ,\cr
\hbox{rotations:}\qquad && \sum_{i\ \in\ \hbox{U detectors}} \De \rh_i = \sum_{i\ \in\ \hbox{V detectors}} \De \rh_i = 0\ .

As the last comment, let us recall that the $\mat S$ scales approximately with the number of events $N_{\rm events}$ (see \Eq{al S norm eig val}). In order to simplify the interpretation of the eigenvalues of the alignment matrix (the \lhs~of \Eq{al alignment equation}), it is advantageous to let the $\mat C$ matrix scale with $N_{\rm events}$ too. This effectively means to use
\eqref{\mat C = N_{\rm events}\, \mat C^0\ ,}{al C scaled}
where $\mat C^0$ is one of the constraint choices above.


\subsection[al err]{Errors}

In the previous section we have derived \Eq{al alignment equation} that solves the alignment task. In this section we will focus on the uncertainties of the alignment solution.

First of all, let us remark that any error that might appear can be of few origins only: the \em{approximations} used to derive the alignment equations and \em{neglected effects} (e.g. multiple scattering) and \em{data corruption} (electronic noise, problems in the DAQ chain etc.). One can check the presence of problems of the latter type by dividing the sample into a number of subsamples. Were the results obtained from the subsamples not compatible with each other, these effects would be important (however, in \Sc{al lhc res} we will see it is not the case). Now, let us review the approximations we have made.

\> We have neglected the \em{resolution error} (formally the $\De m$ term in \Eq{al measurement}). According to the discussion in \Sc{al psi}, it is reasonable to assume that ($P$ denotes the pitch of the sensors)
\eqref{\eqnarray{
	&\bullet \hbox{ the resolution error is a random variable uniformly distributed on } (-P/2, +P/2) \hbox{ and}\cr
	&\bullet \hbox{ the resolution errors in different detectors are independent.}\cr
}}{al resolution err mod}
Given the low angles of the LHC tracks, the second point might look doubtful. But we will show (in \Fg{al stat fixDet} for instance) that it leads to satisfactory results though.

\par\parindent\itindent\indent\hang
An important property of the resolution error is that the errors in different events are independent. If one doubles the sample, the errors in the second half will be independent of those in the first one. Consequently, one may expect better results with increasing sample size. As rule of thumb, the error should be proportional to $1/\sqrt{N_{\rm events}}$ where $N_{\rm events}$ is the sample size. That is why the pitch rounding error is of \em{statistical nature}.

\> In deriving \Eq{al effective measurement} we have neglected a number of terms. Most notably all \em{terms non-linear in the alignment corrections}. Since the corrections are small, the non-linear terms lead only small relative errors. For example for the rotation-matrix linearization, see \Eq{al small rotation approximation}, the order of the neglected terms over the retained terms is $10^{-5}$. Following the order estimates from \Sc{al psi} we can conclude that the error due to dropping the non-linear terms is negligible.

\> In the definition of the $\hat\mat\Ga$ matrices, we have replaced the true track parameters by the track fits neglecting the misalignments (see \Eq{al tau linearization}). Thus the fitted \em{track parameters are biased} by the presence of misalignments. In contrary to the resolution error, here it makes sense expecting the error to be independent of the sample size. In other words, this is a  \em{systematic error}.

\vskip\itskip

In \Sc{al psi} when describing the interaction of a proton with a silicon sensor, we wrote the proton creates electron-hole pairs along its trajectory. But in addition the proton can interact with silicon nuclei, leading to an angular deflection. This phenomenon is often called \em{multiple scattering}. In Sc.~7.5.2 in \bref{hubert} the size of this effect was evaluated for the TOTEM RPs. The result for a single RP is that the angular deflection is a random variable with zero mean and standard deviation about $0.55\un{\mu rad}$. With the lever-arm given by the length of a $220\un{m}$ station (the worst situation), it leads to an elongation about $3\un{\mu m}$. Since the multiple scattering is a random process, the resulting error would add up with the resolution error. From \Eq{al resolution err mod} we get the standard deviation $19.05\un{\mu m}$, when the multiple scattering is added it increases to $19.29\un{\mu m}$. The multiple scattering is thus a minor effect for the alignment application.

Now let us rewrite some of the above statements a bit more formally. The $\tilde\vec T$ vector that appears on the \rhs.~of the alignment equation \Eq{al alignment equation} can be calculated from \Eq{al exact fit equation}. Considering that the measurements $\vec\mu$ gain a contribution $\De\vec\mu$ from the resolution error, we can write
\eqref{\tilde\vec T =
	\tilde\mat S \vec\ch
	+ \underbrace{(\bar\mat S - \tilde\mat S) \vec\ch}_{\De\vec T_{\rm syst}}
	+ \De\vec T_{\rm stat}
\ .}{al vec T error}
The $\De\vec T_{\rm stat}$ is induced by the resolution error ($\De\vec\mu$) and corresponds to the statistical error component. The $\De\vec T_{\rm syst}$ reflects the difference between the $\mat S$ matrices with bar and tilde which differ only by using true or fitted track parameters (see \Eq{al fit equation,al exact fit equation}). It therefore corresponds to the systematic error due to the biased track parameters. By construction it is proportional to the true alignments $\vec\ch$, that is the difference between the true and thought geometry. Note also that it receives no contribution from the singular-mode components of $\vec\ch$.

This can be inserted into \Eq{al cnst sol} which describes the solution of the alignment task. It yields a long expression
\eqref{\hat\vec\ch =
	\underbrace{\mat Q_{\rm r} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T }_{\mat P_{\rm r}} \vec \ch
	+ \underbrace{\mat Q_{\rm s} (\mat C^\T \mat Q_{\rm s})^{-1} \vec V}_{\vec\ch_{\rm C}}
	+ \underbrace{\mat P^\T \mat Q_{\rm r} \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \mat P \De\vec T_{\rm syst}}_{\De\vec\ch_{\rm syst}}
	+ \underbrace{\mat P^\T \mat Q_{\rm r} \mat L^{-1} \mat Q_{\rm r}^\T \mat P \De\vec T_{\rm stat}}_{\De\vec\ch_{\rm stat}}
}{al sol err}
with an easy interpretation. The first term is the projection of the true misalignments to the regular modes. The second term is what is added by the constraints. The last two terms correspond to the systematic and statistical errors of the alignment solution $\hat\vec\ch$. We have started with \Eq{al cnst sol} which is only valid when no weak modes are constrained. If they are, the result differs slightly from \Eq{al cnst sol}. However, the difference is the smaller the weaker the weak modes are. In any case, the difference can be included in the systematic error $\De\ch_{\rm syst}$.

Using the fitted track parameters in the $\Ga$ matrices (see \Eq{al tau linearization}) is unavoidable. We can only hope that the induced (systematic) error is not too large and applying the alignment corrections (as resolved from \Eq{al alignment equation}) will improve our knowledge about the geometry. If so, one may perform several alignment iterations. In the second iteration we would have a better knowledge of the geometry, thus the track fits would be closer to the true track parameters, consequently there would be less bias and one might expect more accurate alignment results.

This iteration process is sketched in \Tb{al iter} in a greater detail. In the beginning we think the geometry is $g_0$ while the true one is $g$. In the first iteration we would like to obtain alignment corrections $\hat\vec\ch = g - g_0$. This is not possible for two reasons: the presence of singular and weak modes and the alignment errors. The expectation for the alignment correction is shown in the right-most column. It comes from \Eq{al sol err}, in addition we have written explicitly the dependence of the systematical error $\De\vec\ch_{\rm syst}$ on $g - g_0$, that is ``how far we are from the true geometry.'' During the iteration this ``distance'' is reducing and so does the systematic error. On contrary, the statistical errors is almost constant -- the resolution error $\De m$ does not change, only the $\tilde\mat\Ga$ are altered slightly. The iterations stop when no further improvement can be made, formally $|\hat\vec\ch^n|$ is smaller than a certain limit.

\tab[\strut\quad\hfil#\qquad&#\hfil\qquad&#\hfil\quad\cr]{al iter}{A scheme of alignment iterations with the error evolution.}{\ln
	& geometry & alignment correction \cr\ln
	& $g_0$ \cr
iteration $1$ & $\downarrow$ & $\hat\vec\ch_1 = \mat P_{\rm r} (g - g_0) + \vec\ch_{\rm C} + \De\vec\ch_{\rm syst}(g - g_0) + \De\vec\ch_{\rm stat}$ \cr
	& $g_1 = g_0 + \hat\vec\ch_1$ &   \cr

last iteration $n$ & $\downarrow$ & $|\hat\vec\ch_n| < \hbox{limit}$ \cr
	& $g_n = g_{n-1} + \hat\vec\ch_n$ &  \cr\ln
}

After the iteration process has converged, the final error still have two components -- the statistical and the systematic. The latter one is proportional to the distance to the actual geometry. The distance can not vanish because of two reasons -- the statistical error and the constraints (in case the constraints are not compatible with the true geometry). Let us recall that the singular modes do not contribute to the systematic error, see \Eq{al vec T error}. Hence only the constrained weak modes can lead to an error of this type (they are both constrained and non-singular). For the RP sensors this is the case of $U$-$V$ and far-near unit rotations, they will be studied in the next section, see \Fg{al syst err uv rot,al syst err fn rot}.

As the last comment related to the iterations, let us mention the typical number of steps. Both in MC tests (\Sc{al mc tests}) and real data analyses (\Sc{al int res,al lhc res}), two iterations have turned out to be sufficient. That is, the correction in the third one has already been negligible.

Now, let us estimate the size of the statistical error $\De\ch_{\rm stat}$. It originates in the resolution error $\De m$, thus one may take the model \Eq{al resolution err mod} and propagate the error to the alignment result $\hat\vec\ch$. For the error propagation one may use formula (4.19) from \bref{barlow}:
\eqref{\vec y = \mat M\vec x \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \Var\vec y = \mat M\ \Var\vec x\ \mat M^\T\ .}{error prop}
In \Eq{al mat V} we have used the symbol $\mat V$ for the variance matrix of the sensor measurements. Since in our model the only random variables are the resolutions errors, $\mat V$ corresponds to their variance matrix. Then, from the definition of $\tilde\vec T$ \Eq{al fit equation} and following the properties of the $\si^n$ matrix \Eq{al prop sigma n} it is straightforward to see that $\Var \tilde\vec T = \tilde\mat S$. Propagating the error further through \Eq{al alignment equation}, one obtains the variance of the alignment result
\eqref{\Var \pmatrix{\tilde\vec\ch\cr \vec\La} = 
	\pmatrix{
		\tilde\mat S & \mat C \cr
		\mat C^\T & 0\cr
	}^{-1}
	\pmatrix{
		\tilde\mat S& 0\cr
		0 & 0}
	\pmatrix{
		\tilde\mat S & \mat C \cr
		\mat C^\T & 0\cr
	}^{-1}\ .
}{al stat err}
The standard deviation of the $\hat\vec\ch$ vector components can be found on the diagonal of the matrix above:
\eqref{\si(\hat\ch_i) = \sqrt{\Var \pmatrix{\hat\vec\ch\cr  \vec\La}_{i\,i}}}{al stat err chi}



\subsection[al mc tests]{Monte-Carlo tests}

In the previous sections we have developed a method of track-based alignment and have derived some of its characteristics (inaccessible alignment modes, error behavior, etc.). Before applying the method to real LHC data, we have made a handful of MC tests to validate our theoretical findings.

Using the full simulation chain including Geant4 (see \Fg{sr sw structure}) is very resource demanding and severely limits the number of simulations that can be done in a reasonable time. For our alignment studies we have used a fast simulation (see \Sc{fast simu}) instead. The fast simulation skips the detailed simulations of charge creation and collection and electronic response, it uses an effective model instead. The neglected effects shall be much smaller that the resolution error, which is the leading statistical error that we consider for the alignment (see \Eq{al resolution err mod}). Therefore within this error, we expect the fast simulation to provide a good tool for alignment studies.

All our simulations have been done with the $220\un{m}$ station in sector 56. We have tried a number of track distributions, but the impact on the alignment results has been small, as it should. For the figures in this section, we have used a track distribution which resembles the one observed in the LHC data -- both track slopes $a_x$ and $a_y$ generated according to a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation $\si_a$, the intercepts $b_x$ and $b_y$ (at $z=217\un{m}$) according to normal distributions with zero means and standard deviations $\si_x = 6\un{mm}$ and $\si_y= 8\un{mm}$.

Our first MC tests have been to verify the statistical behavior of the alignment results. In particular how the statistical and systematic errors depend on the size of a track sample used. For each sample size we have generated 20 samples (with different random seeds). For each sample we have made two simulations, each followed by an alignment analysis. For the \em{realistic simulation}, the sensor hit positions have been rounded to the nearest (inter-)strip position (see \Sc{fast simu}) and fitted track parameters (that is $\hat\mat\Ga$) have been used. This corresponds to the alignment application to real data. The second simulation has been made to get a reference alignment result with no errors included. For this \em{reference simulation} the sensor hit positions have not been rounded and true track parameters (that is $\mat\Ga$) have been used. The alignment analyses have been performed in three iterations, yielding a result and its uncertainty estimate. Then, from the 20 samples of the same size we have calculated the following quantities.
\eqref{\vbox{\halign{\quad\strut#\qquad&#\quad\cr\ln

\hbox{standard deviation (realistic result - reference result)}& \hbox{statistical error} \cr

}}}{al stat quan def}
Two examples of such statistical studies can be found in \Fg{al stat fixDet} (with a set of fixed-sensors constraints) and \Fg{al stat final} (with the final constraints).

For \Fg{al stat fixDet} the rotations have been fixed only in the near unit. Following our discussion of weak modes in \Sc{al sing modes} (see especially \Fg{al eig theta}), we may expect high alignment uncertainties for the far unit. The figure confirms this expectation (compare top and bottom two rows). Let us make three more observations. First, the systematic error is compatible with zero within the its uncertainty (semi-transparent band). Second, the estimated uncertainty falls as $1/\sqrt{N_{\rm events}}$, which confirms our rule of thumb mentioned below \Eq{al resolution err mod}. Third, the ratio of the statistical error to the estimated uncertainty is almost flat, but below the expected value of one. This means that the uncertainty estimated with the help of the model \Er{al resolution err mod} is slightly overestimated. This might, in fact, partly compensate our neglecting the multiple scattering.

The same three observations could be made for \Fg{al stat final}, which corresponds to the final constraints. These fix the far-near unit rotation weak mode, thereby the alignment uncertainties are similar for both near and far unit.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_stat_fixDet.pdf}{al stat fixDet}{A statistical study of the alignment method with a set of fixed-sensors constraints. For the read-out-direction shifts we have fixed the first two sensors in the top-near and the last two sensors in the top-far pot. Regarding the rotations, the first two sensors have been fixed. The simulations have been performed with a realistic track slope spread $\si_a = 0.1\un{mrad}$. Each curve corresponds to the third sensor of a pot, see the legend.

In the above figures we have not showed any plots for the $z$ shifts. The reason is their quite special behavior. We recall that the $\ga$ coefficients related to the shifts in $z$ are proportional to the track angle (see \Tb{al alignment quantities}). Thus if the variation of the track angles is too small, one can expect a bad resolution. This fact is documented in \Fg{al err shz theta}. For the LHC-typical angular spread (see \Tb{al lhc datasets}), the uncertainty is about $1\un{m}$, which is much worse than the misalignment expectation, see \Tb{al exp misal}. Since the track-based alignment can not improve our knowledge about the detectors' $z$-positions, we will focus on read-out-direction shifts and rotations only it in what follows.

Simulations performed with $10^5$ events and a set of fixed-sensors constraints (for $z$ shifts: first two sensors in near-top and last two sensors in far-top pot). For each pot, the uncertainty of 2nd or 3rd sensor (according to its $U$ or $V$ orientation) is shown, for the other sensors the situation is very similar. The vertical dotted line shows the typical track angular spread for LHC data.

}

Let us have a more detailed look at the weak modes now. From \Sc{al sing modes} we know there are two of them for TOTEM RPs: the rotation between $U$ and $V$ sensors and the rotation between far and near units. The former is, in fact, a singular mode for the nominal geometry (which comprises two read-out groups only), see \Tb{al sing mode overview}. However, because of rotation misalignments, the true geometry is not a two-group one and consequently the singular mode becomes weak only, see the transition in \Fg{al eig rho} (middle row).

A similar transition is shown in \Fg{al err rotz rho}. Again, a series of geometries has been considered, starting with the nominal one and adding rotation misalignments, randomly generated according to a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation $\si_\rh$ (on the horizontal axis). For this plot, we have fixed the rotation of one sensor only: the first one in near-top RP. It is a $V$ sensor. Consequently, the alignment uncertainties for all $V$ sensors (left plot) are practically $\si_\rh$-independent. In contrary for the $U$ sensors (right plot), the uncertainties grow with decreasing $\si_\rh$, as expected. The uncertainties for the far unit pots are higher than for the near unit (we recall that the fixed sensor is in the near one). This is related to the other weak mode (far-near unit rotation), which will be discussed later, in \Fg{al err rotz theta}. Focusing on the near unit, we see that for the expected misalignments (the dotted vertical line) the uncertainty for $V$ sensors is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}\un{mrad}$, while for the $U$ sensors it grows over $1\un{mrad}$. For this plot a sample of $10^5$ tracks has been used, it is a typical number for the LHC runs. Now, comparing the results to the expected misalignments in \Tb{al exp misal}, drawn as the dotted horizontal line, we conclude that the track-based alignment can not provide reasonable corrections to the $U$ sensors' rotations. We recall that the $U$ sensors turn out to be problematic in this example as we have fixed the rotation of the $V$ sensors by the constraints. Generally, the troublesome mode is the relative rotation between $U$ and $V$ sensors.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_err_rotz_rho.pdf}{al err rotz rho}{The estimated uncertainty of the rotations about $z$ as a function of geometry. The geometries considered have been derived from the nominal one by applying rotation misalignments to each sensor. These misalignments have been randomly generated according to a normal distribution with zero mean and variance $\si_\rh^2$ (the quantity on the horizontal axis). The expected misalignment is marked by the vertical dotted line. The simulations have been done with $10^5$ events, track angular spread $\si_a = 0.1\un{mrad}$ and a set of fixed-sensors constraints. The only sensor with fixed rotation has been the first one in the top-near RP (it is a $V$ sensor). Each line corresponds to the uncertainty of the 2nd or 3rd sensor (according to its $U$ or $V$ orientation) of a RP. Solid lines have been used for RPs in the near, dashed for RPs in the far unit. The lines for far vertical pots are overlapping. The horizontal dotted line shows the expected rotation misalignment.
%No misalignment (misaligned and real geometry contain detectors rotated with the given rho distribution).  Extfit=false. fix-bas, 1 iteration, 1 repetition
}

The other weak mode is related to the rotation between far and near units. In fact we have derived in \Eq{al sm rotz sol la} is a linearly progressive rotation. But looking at the structure of $220\un{m}$ stations (see \Tb{ttm rp station}), we see that the RPs cluster into two units -- each about $45\un{cm}$ in length and separated by about $5.5\un{m}$. Since their distance is much higher than their size, the linearly progressive rotation effectively reduces to a rotation of the near unit and a rotation of the far unit. Moreover, the global rotation must be constrained (see the singular mode \Eq{al sm rotz sol}), thus what is left for the weak mode is the relative far-near unit rotation.

As indicated by \Fg{al eig theta}, the weakness of this mode depends on the angular spread $\si_a$ of the tracks used. Since the weakness is related to the alignment uncertainty, see \Eq{al fit eq eigen one}, one may expect growing uncertainty with reducing angular spread (and increasing weakness of the weak mode). This trend is well confirmed by \Fg{al err rotz theta}. For that figure we have fixed the rotations of the first two sensors in the near-top pot. The uncertainties of near top and bottom pot (having the same $z$ position) are practically flat. The near horizontal pot, being about $45\un{cm}$ from the constrained sensors, already feels some dependence on the angular spread. For the pots in the far unit the effect is even stronger. Considering a realistic value of the angular spread $\si_a =  0.1\un{mrad}$ and a typical number of tracks $10^5$ (see \Tb{al lhc datasets}), the uncertainty is $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-2}\un{mrad}$ for near and about $1\un{mrad}$ for far unit RPs. This is to be compared with the expected misalignments from \Tb{al exp misal} (drawn as the horizontal dotted line). One may conclude that the track-based alignment can hardly improve our knowledge on the far-near unit rotation.

Let us repeat the reason for the saturation at the high-$\si_a$ side of \Fg{al err rotz theta}. The maximal angle that can be detected by both units simultaneously is about $10^{-2}\un{rad}$, therefore even if the track sample includes higher angle tracks, they do not contribute to the alignment analysis.

}

\Fg{al err rotz rho,al err rotz theta} tell us to constrain the $U$-$V$ and far-near rotations in order to get reasonable alignment results. However, in \Sc{al err} we have mentioned that constraining weak modes may lead to a systematic error (when the constraints are not compatible with the true misalignment). Although we have not observed any sizable effect of that sort in \Fg{al stat final} (the final constraints include both types weak modes), let us verify it explicitly.

To study the effect of the $U$-$V$ rotation we have considered a series of misalignment scenarios. They have contained no shifts in the read-out direction, the rotations have been generated randomly according to a normal distribution with a standard deviation of $1\un{mrad}$. For $V$ sensors the distribution have had zero mean, for $U$ sensors the mean has been set to $\rh_{U-V}$ (which therefore corresponds to the relative $U$-$V$ rotation). For each misalignment scenario we have made the realistic and reference simulations (defined above \Eq{al stat quan def}) with the final constraints. The difference in results (systematic error) is plotted in \Fg{al syst err uv rot}. One can conclude that for the expected $U$-$V$ rotation of the order $1\un{mrad}$, the systematic errors are negligible.

%One can see the errors are practically zero for $U$ detectors (solid lines), but non-zero for $V$ (detectors). This can be easily understood from the form of the $\ga$ coefficient for rotations (see \Tb{alignment quantities}) -- it contains the direction perpendicular to the read-out one. And in the nominal geometry, the direction perpendicular to $U$ is $\pm V$ and vice versa. Hence by neglecting (not determining) the rotations of $U$ detectors, one biases the $\ga$ coefficients for $V$ detectors (and gives raise to the related error).

A similar study has been made for the systematic error induced by constraining the far-near rotation. Again, the misalignment scenarios have had no read-out-direction shifts and the rotations two components. All sensors have had the random component, the far-unit sensors also a rotation $\rh_{\rm F-N}$ (which gives the rotation between the units). The resulting systematic errors are shown in \Fg{al syst err fn rot}. For the expected far-near rotations of order of few milliradians, the systematic errors are negligible.

\subsection[al data sel]{Input data selection}

In the above MC tests we have simulated one proton track per event. Thus, we have known a priory that all detector hits have belonged to the track of a given event. For real LHC data, the situation is more complicated. There might be a number of tracks per event, moreover different in every RP. There might be a number of hits that do not belong to any particle track -- noise, data corruption, etc. That is why it is necessary to select carefully the input for the track-based alignment. It is better to loose some statistics than to bias the results with false input.

The selection algorithm has two components: \em{hit selection} and \em{event selection}. In the first one, doubtful hits may be removed. In the latter, entire events may be dropped, if found suspicious..

The hit selection is integrated with track fitting and can be described as follows.
\bitm
\itm Input: the collection of all hits from all sensors (in all RPs).
\itm Local track fit -- a least squares fit with track parameterization \Eq{al local track}. This is the fit which determines the $\hat\vec a$ and $\hat\vec b$ (or shortly $\hat\vec\ta$) track parameters used in \Eq{al tau linearization}.
\itm Outlier removal. From the hit collection, we remove all hits for which
\eqref{m_i - \hat m_i > \pmt{maxResidualToSigma}\ \si(m_i)\ ,}{al outlier cond}
where $\hat m_i = \vec d_i \cdot (\hat\vec a^n z_i + \hat\vec b^n)$ is the track-fit interpolation and $\si(m_i)$ is the corresponding measurement uncertainty (i.e. a square root of the corresponding diagonal element of a $\mat V^n$ matrix, see \Eq{al mat V}). \pmt{maxResidualToSigma} is a parameter of the algorithm.
\itm Suspicious pot removal. We remove all hits from the RPs where there are less hits per projection than a given limit \pmt{minimumHitsPerProjectionPerRP}.
\itm If some points have been removed in steps 3 or 4, go back to step 2; stop otherwise.
\eitm

The event selection starts with a $\ch^2$ cut, that is all events with track fits the $\ch^2/\hbox{n.d.f.}$ of which exceeds a limit \pmt{chiSqPerNdfCut} are discarded. Then, there are several optional checks, see \Tb{al alg flags}. They can control which event types are used for the alignment.

\tab[\strut\hfil#\ &#\hfil\cr]{al alg flags}{The options of the event selection algorithm.}{\ln
parameter							& meaning\cr\ln
\pmt{removeImpossible} 				& remove events with signal in a top and a bottom pot simultaneously\cr
\pmt{requireBothUnits} 				& require signal in both units\cr
\pmt{requireOverlap} 				& require signal in the overlap between horizontal and vertical pots\cr
\pmt{requireAtLeast3PotsInOverlap}	& if there is signal in the overlap, require signal in at least three pots\cr\ln
}

The values of the selection algorithms parameters will be given for each analysis in \Sc{al int res,al lhc res}. Let us only remark that some of these parameters will be changed during iterations. For example the parameter of the outlier cut \Eq{al outlier cond} or the one of the $\ch^2$ cut will be made increasingly strict, as we will approach the expected alignment corrections (see the \rhs~column in \Tb{al iter}) decrease.


\subsection[al rp fac]{Alignment of detector packages}

As anticipated in the introduction, the elementary objects for the track-based alignment are the sensors. However, the sensors are stacked into rigid detector packages (see \Sc{ttm}) and therefore each sensor inherits the misalignment of its package. Moreover, the expected misalignments of sensors within a package are much smaller than the misalignments of packages within a station (see \Tb{al exp misal}). Thus it makes sense to extract the common misalignments of all sensors of a package and call them \em{detector-package (DP) misalignments}.

It is straight-forward to introduce the DP misalignments in the formalism presented in \Sc{al psi}. One has to split the global (station) to local (sensor) coordinate transformation \Eq{al global to local} into two steps: station to DP and DP to sensor. This naturally defines the placement of a DP in a station and the placement of a sensor in a DP. Each placement may in reality differ from the nominal, in other words there may be an misalignment (c.f.~\Eq{al misalignments}). Then, repeating the steps leading to \Eq{al hit v} yields
\eqref{
	\De\rh_{z_i} = \De\rh_z^{\rm DP} + \De\rh_{z_i}^{\rm S}\ ,\qquad
	\De\vec c_i = \De\vec c^{\rm DP} + \De\vec c_i^{\rm S} - \pmatrix{\rh_y^{\rm DP}\cr \rh_x^{\rm DP}} \ze_i\ .
}{al dp sen al}
For the rotations about $z$, the interpretation is simple: the full rotation of the $i$-th sensor is given by a sum of the rotation of the DP within the station ($\De\rh_z^{\rm DP}$) and the rotation of the sensor within the DP ($\De\rh_z^{\rm S}$). The transverse-shift part can be interpreted similarly, with the exception of the last term, which reflects the fact that the entire DP is rotated about the $x$ and $y$ axes (see the illustration in \Fg{al rp misalignment}). The rotations angles $\rh_x^{\rm DP}$ and $\rh_y^{\rm DP}$ are defined by \Eq{al rotation parameterization}. The parameter $\ze_i$ gives the $z$ distance of the $i$-th sensor from the center of the DP (see \Tb{ttm det package}).

\fig{fig/pdf/al_rp_misalignment.pdf}{al rp misalignment}{A side view on a detector package (for simplicity only four sensors are drawn). The DP is shifted by $\De c^{\rm DP}$ (green arrow) and rotated by $\De\rh_x^{\rm DP}$ about the $x$ axis. The shifts of the individual sensors $\De\vec c_i$ are drawn as the blue arrows. For simplicity we have not considered the sensor shifts within the package, that is $\De\vec c_i^{\rm S} = 0$. The hollow/full dots mark the nominal/actual positions of sensor centers.}

As already mentioned, the sensor misalignments within a package are expected to be much smaller that the misalignments of DPs in a station. This means that the $\De\rh_{z_i}^{\rm S}$ and $ \De\vec c_i^{\rm S}$ terms play a minor role in \Eq{al dp sen al}. Treating these terms as perturbations, one may apply the LS method in order to calculate the DP misalignments. For the rotations about $z$, the fit equation may be written
\eqref{
	\De\rh_z^{\rm DP} = (\mat F^\T \mat V^{-1} \mat F)^{-1} \mat F^\T \mat V^{-1} \pmatrix{\vdots\cr \De\rh_i\cr\vdots}\ ,\qquad
	\mat F = \pmatrix{\vdots\cr 1\cr\vdots}\ .
}{al dp rotz}
The $(\ldots, \De\rh_i, \ldots)^\T$ vector groups the rotation alignment results (from \Eq{al alignment equation}) for all sensors of a given DP. The covariance matrix of this vector is denoted $V$. In fact, this formula corresponds to a weighted mean over the $\De\rh_i$ values. We have used this form as the same one can be used for the other DP alignment parameters.

The other two DP rotations and its transverse shift components can be extracted from the vector of the read-out-direction shifts:
\eqref{
	\pmatrix{c_x^{\rm DP}\cr c_y^{\rm DP}\cr \rh_x^{\rm DP}\cr \rh_y^{\rm DP}\cr} =
	(\mat F^\T \mat V^{-1} \mat F)^{-1} \mat F^\T \mat V^{-1}
	\pmatrix{\vdots\cr \De s_i\cr \vdots}\ ,\qquad
	\mat F = \pmatrix{
		\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\cr
		d_{x_i} & d_{y_i} & -d_{y_i}\,\ze_i & -d_{x_i}\,\ze_i\cr
		\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\cr
	}\ .
}{al dp shz}
Again, the index $i$ goes through all the sensors of a given package. The $\mat V$ symbol represents the covariance matrix of the $(\ldots, \De s _i, \ldots)^\T$ vector.

Two examples of such an analysis can be found in \Fg{al comp rp all rot} and \Tb{al rp rot}.


\subsection[al int res]{Internal alignment results}

In this section we are going to compare the alignment of sensors within a package (the internal alignment) obtained from three sources. The first one is an optical metrology, the other two are track-based alignment analyses of two types of data -- beam test/cosmic rays and LHC runs.

\caption{Optical metrology}

The position of the sensors with respect to their hybrids was measured during the package assembly. A high-zoom camera was used to photograph each sensor on hits hybrid, which allowed to measure the positions of two sensor fiducial marks with respect to a reference point on the hybrid frame, see \Fg{al optical metrology}. Each coordinate was determined with a precision about $10\un{\mu m}$.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_optical_metrology.pdf}{al optical metrology}{An illustration of the optical metrology measurement. The two fiducial marks are drawn in blue, the reference mark on the hybrid frame in red. The numbers give the ideal measurements.}

From the four measured coordinates one can extract the (misalignment) shift and rotation of each sensor:
\eqref{
	\hbox{rotation} = {y_2 - y_1\over x_2 - x_1}\ ,\qquad
	x\hbox{ shift} = {x_1 + x_2\over 2} - \bar x\ ,\qquad
	y\hbox{ shift} = {y_1 + y_2\over 2} - \bar y\ ,
}{al metrology ext}
where $\bar x$ and $\bar y$ are the arithmetic means of the ideal values shown in \Fg{al optical metrology}. The shifts in the read-out direction $\De s$ then follow from \Eq{al shr def}. By error propagation, the expected uncertainty is about $7\un{\mu m}$ for shifts and about $0.3\un{\mu rad}$ for rotations.

Most of the results will be presented later in comparison with the other methods. But let us remark that this is the only method sensitive to the rotation between $U$ and $V$ sensors. See \Tb{al opt uv rot} for a list of the $U$-$V$ rotations determined per pot. These rotation are about an order of magnitude smaller that the expected rotation misalignments (\Tb{al exp misal}).

}

Let us repeat that this metrology measured the relative position of a sensor on its hybrid frame. It is only one component of the internal alignment. The other component is the alignment of the hybrid frames in the detector packages. The latter contribution is expected small, but is unfortunately unknown.

\caption{Beam test and cosmic rays runs}

Every RP was tested with a muon beam or cosmic rays prior to its installation in the LHC. These tests took place at a TOTEM test facility at H8 (a CERN test hall). That is why we will refer to these tests as H8 tests. There was always one RP studied at a time. What will turn out important is that, at H8 the RPs were kept a different temperature than in the LHC.

\Tb{al H8 stat} presents some statistics about the data sample collected for each pot. Besides the total number of events and the number of tracks used for alignment, we have indicated the track angular spreads. The trend is clear, muon beams compared to cosmic rays provided many more events, but with more collimated tracks.


The track-based alignment has been performed with the following settings.

}}\hss}

\noindent Five iterations have been performed in total. In the first two, only the read-out shifts have been optimized (s in the table), in the rest the rotations about $z$ have been added (s+r). This has been done in order to increase stability -- during our MC tests the shifts have proven to be more resistant to any sort of problems. That is why we have added the rotations only when the cuts could have been set tight enough to select very good tracks only. On contrary, in the first iteration we have started with rather loose cuts -- hit residuals allowed up ten times the hit uncertainty. Since the uncertainty is most often $19\un{\mu m}$, the residual cut has been $190\un{\mu m}$. Comparing this value to the expected internal misalignments (the first column in \Tb{al exp misal}), one may find it exaggerated, but our goal has been to allow for even very large misalignments.

%The value of the \pmt{chiSqPerNdfCut} parameter has been derived from \pmt{maxResidualToSigma}. 
%\TODO{chi**2 cut = maxResidualToSigma**2 / 2. Why the division}

We have used a set of fixed-sensors constraints. First we have tried to constrain for rotations only one sensor per projection. But as it is shown in \Fg{al comp det per pot dp1 ext}, the linearly-progressive rotation (the weak mode \Eq{al sm rotz sol la}) is poorly determined and spoils the results. Therefore we have constrained two more sensors -- eventually constraining first and last two sensors (for both shifts and rotations).

\fig{fig/pdf/al_comp_det_per_pot_dp2_ext.pdf}{al comp det per pot dp1 ext}{An attempt to determine the rotations about $z$ with one fixed sensor per projection (first two sensors of the RP).}

As suggested in \Sc{al err}, it is a good idea to split the event sample into several subsamples and compare the alignment results among them. In this way one can check for present of problems like data corruption. For the H8 data, we have performed alignment analyses with full sample and two subsamples -- with even and odd event numbers. All results will be shown later, in a comparison to the optical metrology and LHC data alignment analyses.


\caption{LHC runs and comparisons}

We have also analyzed data from a number of LHC runs (see the list in \Tb{al lhc datasets}). The track-based alignment has been performed in very much the same way as for the H8 runs. \Fg{al comp det per pot dp1 ext2,al comp det per pot dp2 ext2} show the comparisons of the tree internal-alignment methods for two RPs. The former figure represents the RPs with a bad match between the methods, the former shows one of the best matches the we have observed.

Let us conclude the comparisons (generally, even for the ten other comparisons not shown). First observation is that all LHC results are perfectly consistent with each other. Similarly, there is no remarkable difference between the H8 analyses using the full sample or either from the subsamples. These are, with no doubt, pleasant outcomes. Generally, the match is better for the rotations. Regarding the optical metrology this might be partially understood by noticing that a part (systematic shift) of the measurement errors cancels for rotations in \Eq{al metrology ext}. Also quite generally, the H8 and LHC results match better together than with the optical metrology. This might be an indication that the alignment component not taken into account in the optical metrology, is in fact important. The difference between the H8 and LHC results may be understood as a consequence of different temperatures of the pots. Due to the thermal expansion, the mechanical stresses might lay out slightly differently, provoking slightly different misalignments.

In total five iterations were performed. In the first two only the read-out shifts were optimized, then the rotations about $z$ were added. The reason was to remove as many pathological evens as possible before the rotations are optimized. The rotations are sensitive and if used from the very beginning, the convergence might be endangered. Some of the selection cuts were tightened during iterations, see \Tb{al LHC iter par}. \TODO{Justify the values}.



$U$-$V$ rotation is impossible to determine, not even showing. However, the optical metrology suggests that is rather small, see \Tb{al opt uv rot}.

An attempt to determine the far-near rotations is in \Fg{al comp det per unit weak}. Here all runs are used (even those without horizontal RPs). The standard results (i.e. with final constraints) are taken as the starting point, then 5 iterations made with fixed-detectors constraints (fixed rotation planes: 1200 and 1201). The results are practically identical in the near unit, but incompatible in the far one. Moreover, in the far unit, the results have ''the same shape'' but are ''shifted by a constant''.


\TODO{remove the text below, already done in \Eq{al fit eq eigen one}}
This outcome is quite easy to understand. The alignment equation \Eq{alignment equation} (dropping the constraints for a moment) reads
%$$\bar \mat S \vec\ch = \vec T \equiv \mat S \vec\ch^0 $$
%$$\bar \mat S \vec\ch = \bar\mat S \vec\ch^0 + \underbrace{(\mat S - \bar\mat S) \vec\ch^0}_{\De\vec T}$$
\eqref{\bar \mat S \vec\ch = \bar\mat S \vec\ch^0 + \De\vec T\ ,}{al de T}
where the $\De\vec T$ sums all error contributions. The solution can be symbolically written as
$$\vec\ch = \vec\ch^0 + " {\bar\mat S}^{-1} " \De \vec T$$
This form is quite instructive, although is has very vague mathematical meaning. The message is that for weak modes, with small eigenvalues $\la$, the error contribution
$$\De\vec\ch = \vec\ch - \vec\ch^0 \sim {\De\vec T\over\la}$$
can become big. In our case, the important weak modes are far-near rotations (for $U$ and $V$ detectors separately, see \Tb{al sing mode overview}). Since we constrained the rotations in the near unit, the error would fully manifest in the far one. Looking at the $z$ positions of the RPs (\Tb{ttm rp station}), one can approximate and take one $z$ for the near and one $z$ for the far unit. In this approximation, the error would be constant for every pot (but indeed different for every projection) -- this is exactly the observed effect.

Later, the final constraints were imposed.

As expected, it is not possible to determine the far-near rotations with sufficient precision and therefore we will use the final constraints. Such an example, for 56-220-near unit, is in \Fg{al comp det per unit}. On the first look, one can see the shift points forming lines. This is exactly what one expects with rotated RPs, see \Sc{al rp fac}. The second interesting outcome is the stability of the results, especially for the shifts. The stability of the shifts means that the RP rotations about $x$ and $y$ do not change in time and the stability of the rotations infers the stability of the rotations about $z$ (see also \Fg{al comp rp all rot}).

%overlap=f
}

Let's investigate a bit more the stability of the RP shifts and rotations. Since a comparison for all sensors would require to much space, we decided to compare the RP alignments calculated according to \Eq{al rp fit,al rp rotz fit}. A comparison for unit 56-220-far can be found in \Fg{al comp rp all rot}. For each data-taking there are two points representing two analyses: with \pmt{requireOverlap} = False (circles) and with \pmt{requireOverlap} = True (squares). There were several reasons to do so. First, imagine there were some pathological events biasing the alignment results. Then, splitting the sample into two parts is likely to lead to results incompatible with each other (withing the estimated errors). The overlap requirement provides a subsample selection, moreover the subsample would have a rather different distribution of the rotation $\ga$ factors (see \Tb{alignment quantities}). Hence, this would test also the stability of the rotation determination. Looking at the results, one finds both analyses compatible -- this suggests that the results are robust.

Now, let's return to the RP position stability. Most shift corrections lie in a band of $\pm 10\un{\mu m}$ around the mean (dashed vertical line). This a good result which could have been achieved only thanks to the reliability of the (corrected) LVDT measurements. In fact, the mean values could be used to improve the corrections obtained in \Sc{al collim}. There we determined the corrections for the vertical positions of the vertical pots. Looking at the second row, one finds that track-based alignment brings a modification of $90\un{\mu m}$, which is below the uncertainty of the collimation alignment. Regarding the rotations, the situation is less homogeneous. Some rotations are very stable (all rotations of the horizontal pot), some less ($\rh_z$ of the two vertical pots). For the latter, the fluctuations go up to $\pm 0.4\un{mrad}$ from the mean. This is already an important rotation, which shall not be neglected. A quantitative summary of the rotations can be found in \Tb{al rp rot}. One can see the higher fluctuation of the rotations about $z$ also there.

\fig{fig/pdf/al_comp_rp_all_rot.pdf}{al comp rp all rot}{RP alignment comparison with fixed-detectors constraints. The order of points is the same as in \Tb{al lhc datasets} (top-down in both cases). There are might be two points for each data-set: a circle (all tracks) and a square (overlap tracks only). Showing only 56-220-far unit, in the near one, the $\rh_z$ fluctuations are smaller (see \Fg{al comp det per unit}).}

In fact, such a direct comparison of shifts as in \Fg{al comp rp all rot} is slightly misleading. Every rotation misalignment induces a shift correction, see the $\De\rh \de s_i$ term in \Eq{cnst rotz 6}. This correction is perpendicular to the position of the detector ($\vec c_i$ vector), that's why $\vec d_{\perp_i}$ in the formula. This means that the correction for vertical pots would be horizontal and vertical for horizontal pots. Moreover, the correction is proportional to the distance of the detector from the origin. Hence, this correction would be different for different RP approaches. That is why the comparison for different data-takings is misleading. For the data-takings in \Tb{al lhc datasets}, the thin-window positions varied approximately from $2.6$ to $8\un{mm}$ for the vertical pots and from $2.3$ to $5.6\un{mm}$ for the horizontal pots. The span was, thus, of the order of $\De c \approx 4\un{mm}$. From the \Eq{cnst rotz 6} one could expect the rotation-induced shifts to vary by $\De c \De \rh$. Taking $\De\rh \approx 10 \un{mrad}$ gives us variation by $40\un{\mu m}$. However, in the real case, the variation is much smaller, simulations give the order of $5\un{\mu m}$. There are two reasons for this. First, the final constraints are used, which mix shift and rotation degrees of freedom and make the calculation more complex. And second, the rotations of the top and bottom pots have nearly the same values but opposite signs. This leads to partial cancellations. To summarize, the shifts obtained from different data-takings can be compared within the error of $5\un{\mu m}$.

\section[al prof]{Profile methods}

\TODO{Comment about beam position}
\> beam position is the theoretical hit position of an elastic proton with $\th = 0$ and the mean vertex position.
\> (in our OfflineSW convention, the beam is at zero)
\> misalignements $\De q$ and RP positions $q^{\rm RP}$ (in accordance with \Eq{misalignment definition})
$$q^{\rm RP}(\hbox{actual/misaligned}) = q^{\rm RP}(\hbox{thought/nominal}) + \De q$$
therefore for hit positions $q$
$$q(\hbox{reconstructed with thought geometry}) = q(\hbox{real}) - \De q$$

Profile methods are those which use symmetries in track and/or angular distributions. The expected symmetries depend on the studied physical processes as well as on the optics. However, the vertical symmetry around the beam can be assumed quite generally. If there was no crossing-angle, the process would have full azimuthal symmetry (about the beam axis). Even if the crossing-angle is non-zero, it is horizontal, thus the up-down symmetry is preserved. On the optics side, most of them are designed with vanishing vertical dispersion $D_y$, therefore the vertical symmetry remains also after the proton transport.

This vertical symmetry can be used even on-line, before data-taking, to symmetrize the position of the vertical RPs around the beam. This would increase the low $|t|$ acceptance.

Profile methods have also offline applications, that is those that can provide alignment corrections for registered data. Let us focus low-$\be$ optics, which was the case for 2010 data-takings. \Fg{al prof simu} shows typical hit distributions (MC simulation) for some important forward-physics processes. Beyond the aforementioned vertical symmetry, one can immediately spot the horizontal symmetry of the green points (elastic scattering). The entire next section will be devoted to the alignment with elastic scattering, but let us comment on how to use this symmetry even without separating a sample of elastic events. The ''hot spot'' close to $x\approx 0$ contains also a contribution from non-elastic processes with low $\xi$ (see for example the red dots -- DPE). Due to the horizontal dispersion, the hits are shifted to the right and the symmetry is broken. This can be well seen \Fg{al prof x dists}: the elastic peak is close to zero, but the non-elastic events form a broad structure shifted towards higher $x$ values. But what is important is that around $x=0$, the distribution is dominated by elastics events and their peak can be well fitted, as illustrated in the figure.

\Fg{al prof simu} shows the distributions as expected from simulations, however, in reality they look quite different, see \Fg{al prof hits}. On the first sight, we one can two major differences.
\bitm
\itm The \em{tilt of the elastic peak} (around the red line). Our current understanding is a XY coupling, \TODO{because of ...}
\itm The unexpected distribution of the diffractive hits (around the blue line, mainly for the sector 56). The distribution is tilted and deformed. The slope of the diffractive hits could be explained by the presence of a vertical dispersion \TODO{... more, comment about the shape}.
\eitm

As a consequence of the elastic peak tilt, the peak in the $x$ distribution widens up, see \Fg{al prof x dists} left, and its center does not correspond to the $x$ position of the beam. To mitigate this problem, one may divide the scatter plot into horizontal slices and build and fit the $x$ distributions for each of them (an example is in \Fg{al prof x dists} right; note the thinner peak). Then, the peak positions then be plotted versus the center of the slice, see an example in \Fg{al prof fits} left. The vertical error bands represent the slice widths, the horizontal are coming from the peak fit uncertainty. The points in green were removed as outliers. The red line represent a common fit through top and bottom pot data and it confirms that the tilt is the same for both RPs. Ideally (were there no errors), the red line would go through the beam position.

In principle, the same slicing method could be applied to the diffractive hits (see \Fg{al prof fits} right), however it is complicated by two facts. First, the profile is non-linear (can be seen by bare eyes in \Fg{al prof hits} right and is manifested by the point fluctuation in \Fg{al prof fits} right). Thus the linear-fit result will be burdened by an important systematic error. Since the diffractive hit distribution is wide and therefore the statistical error of the fit is large as well. This all is made even worse by the second complication: since there is just one horizontal pot, the fit must be extrapolated to the beam position. At the end, the error propagation makes this method uninteresting.

\TODO{With an interesting precision, the alignment can be done in the horizontal direction only.}

Practically, the profile alignment is used as the step prior to the alignment with elastic tracks. It simplifies the selection of the elastic sample, but the precision is superseded in the next step.

\section[al elast]{Elastic Alignment}

\TODO{Certain statements hold only for the low $\be$ optics.}

One first needs to select a sample of elastic events...

The transport of elastic events can be well described as \TODO{reference}:
\eqref{\eqnarray{
q(s) &= L_q(s) \th_q^* + v_q(s) q^*\ ,& \qquad q = x, y\cr
\th_q \equiv {\d q\over\d s} &= L_q'(s) \th_q^* + v_q'(s) q^*\ ,& \qquad L_q' \equiv {\d L_q\over \d s}\cr
}}{el transport}
Moreover, the vertex terms can be neglected \TODO{reference}. In addition, the optics is rather symmetric \TODO{reference}, that is:
\eqref{L_q(s) \approx L_q(-s),\quad L_q'(s) \approx - L_q'(-s)\ .}{al el sym opt}
Furthermore, the optics is such that the phase advance $\ph$ (see Hill's equation \Eq{hill eq}) at the $220\un{m}$ stations is close to $\pi/2$ in $x$ or $0$ in $y$ \TODO{reference}. This means that $L_x(220)$ almost vanishes, but $L_x'(220)$ is large and vice versa for the vertical projection.

The $q(s)$ gives the true hit position (wrt. the beam), however a detector (i.e. a RP) misaligned by $\De q$ would make a measurement $q'$:
\eqref{q' = q - \De q\ .}{al el misal}

Later on, we will use the relation between the angle $\th_q$ and far-near difference $q_F - q_N$:
\eqref{q_F - q_N = \th_q \, d\ ,}{al FN diff}
where $d$ stands for the distance between far and near RPs (see \Tb{ttm rp station}).

The above considerations will help us find the properties useful for both, elastic event selection and alignment.

First of all, the angles left and right should be highly correlated. We recall that left stands for sector 45 and right for sector 56. Given the phase advance conditions make the angular resolution in $x$ much better, thus will focus on the horizontal projection. Using the far-near difference, one finds:
\eqref{\De_{F-N} x^{56} \approx \underbrace{ {L_x^{56'}\over L_x^{45'}} }_{-1 + a} \De_{F-N} x^{45} + 
\underbrace{ {L_x^{56'}\over L_x^{45'}} (\De x_F^{45} - \De x_N^{45}) - (\De x_F^{56} - \De x_N^{56}) }_{b} \ .
}{al el dxdx}
The small slope correction $a$ arises from small asymmetries in the optics, the intercept $b$ is an effect of the RP misalignments. The relation is, indeed, just an approximations -- this will be discussed later -- but let's remark that the elastic events will be distributed along the above line, see \Fg{al el selection} (cut 1).

When the vertex terms in \Eq{el transport} are negligible, there is a high correlation between the hit position and the track angle -- the hits will cumulate along line
\eqref{\De_{F-N} y \approx
\underbrace{ {L_y^{N'}\, d\over L_y^N} }_a y_N 
+ \underbrace{ {L_y^{N'}\, d\over L_y^N} \De y_N - (\De y_F - \De y_N) }_b \ .
}{al el dyy}

In the above relation, we used the vertical projection, since the resolution in $x$ is poor -- $L_x\approx 0$ follows from the phase advance settings. This fact can also be used for elastic event selection. In \Sc{al prof} we saw that the actual optics gave raise to the tilts ($a$) of the elastic peaks, the axes of which can be described as
\eqref{x \approx ay + \underbrace{a \De y - \De x}_{b}\ .}{al el x}

The relations \Eq{al el dxdx,al el dyy,al el x} provide the basis for our elastic selection cuts. All of them can be expressed as ''distance from a line must be smaller than a given threshold.'' The details are summarized in \Tb{al el cuts}. The distribution of events around the cut lines has two sources: the beam smearing and the proton transport approximations that we have made. The distributions have a Gaussian shape as can be seen in \Fg{al el selection} and their RMS values were used to set the cut thresholds -- they roughly correspond to $2.5$ multiple of the RMS.

The $a$ and $b$ cut parameters were determined empirically in several iterations. Starting with the values coming from the ideal optics and no misalignments and with liberal cuts. After a selection, the resulting graphs were fitted and improved values of the cut parameters were obtained.

Right: the distribution of events around the cut line (black) with a Gaussian fit (red). The dotted lines show the cut thresholds, cf. \Tb{al el cuts}.}

Since the relations \Eq{al el dxdx,al el dyy,al el x} involve the misalignment parameters, they can be used for alignment purposes. In the rest of this section we will present a few alignment methods. The first one is dedicated to the horizontal alignment, methods 2a-c are several attempts for the vertical alignment. As we will see later on, the precision of the absolute vertical alignment will to be fully satisfactory. That is why we will mention also methods 3 and 4, which can resolve certain relative components of the vertical alignment.

\em{Method 1}: vertical fit in $y$ vs.~$x$ plots. According to \Eq{al el x}, the horizontal shift $\De x = a \De y - b$. The $a$ and $b$ parameters are the result of the fit and $\De y$ can be determined from methods 2a-c. NB: the influence of $\De y$ is small because of the tilts $a$ are small (see \Tb{al el yx}). If $\De y$ would be of the order of $100\un{\mu m}$ and would completely neglect it, the error of $\De x$ would be of the order of $4\un{\mu m}$.

The fits were performed with the parameterization \Eq{al el x}. To reduce the impact of any possible outliers, every hit was assigned weight (one of the suggested outlier treatments from \bref{millepede})
\eqref{w = \left\lbrace \matrix{
\strut 1				& \de < c_H \cr
\strut c_H^2\over\de^2	& \de > c_H \cr
}\right.\ ,\qquad c_H = 1.345\ .}{al el fit weight}
Here, $\de$ stands for the ratio of the hit distance to the fit line and the RMS of the distance distribution. We made five fit iterations.

The uncertainty of the fit was determined as from the Least-Squares method \TODO{reference}. As the error input, we assigned the RMS of the cut-line distance as the error of $x$ variable.

An illustration of the method is shown in \Fg{al el plots yx}. Similar illustrations will be shown for all other methods. The left plot will always be done for the data from 5~Oct (a $18\si$ run with low statistics), while the right plot from 29-30~Oct (a $7\si$ run with high statistics).

The \Fg{al el plots yx} shows the top and bottom RP fits (red and blue) are compatible with each other and the global one (green). This means that the shifts of the top and bottoms are the same. This confirms that the track-base alignment, the previous step, worked correctly.

The results are summarized in \Tb{al el yx}.

\em{Method 2a}. The vertical distribution of elastic hits shall be symmetric around the position of the beam. This remains true even if the axis of elastic scattering is tilted with respect to $y$ axis. In this case, the $y$ distribution shrinks, but symmetrically around the beam's position. Hence a way to determine the position of the beam is to fit a symmetric function through the data registered by a top and bottom pot of the same unit. Looking at the data in \Fg{al el plots y full}, a Gaussian fit looks as a plausible choice. 

The results are summarized in \Tb{al el y full}. The quoted errors are statistical only. They do not reflect the fact that we fit tails of the distribution only (data from 5 Oct), neither the deviations from Gaussian shape (data from 29-30 Oct). The latter deficiency will lead us to a fit improvement, see method 2b.

\em{Method 2b}. In the previous method we fitted the $y$ distributions with a Gaussian, without any justification. In fact, one may expect an (approximately) Gaussian shape for for sufficiently small $|y|$. Here is the reason. $y$ is (approximately) proportional to $\th_y$ and that is proportional to $\th_y^*$ and$\th_y^*$ is normally distributed as far as $\d\si/\d t$ falls off exponentially. This is (approximately) true for $|t|$ below the elastic dip. Actually, the ''elastic dip structures'' can be seen in \Fg{al el plots y gauss} right as the bumps on the tails. Hence one should restrain the Gaussian fit to the data below the elastic dip. In terms of $y$, the limit is $\approx 4.2\un{mm}$ (see the dotted lines in the figure).

For the case of 29-30 Oct, the fit quality improved significantly. For 5 Oct there is no fit, since there are no data in the ''Gaussian'' region, the RPs were not close enough. Unfortunately, this is the case for most data-takings. \Tb{al el y gauss} summarizes the results for the two data-takings where we could apply this method.

The results of methods 2a and 2b (\Tb{al el y full,al el y gauss}) compare surprisingly well. The differences fall below the error estimate (with the only exception of the shift of 56-220-far for the data from 29-30 Oct).

\em{Method 2c}. Another approach to mitigate the deficiency of the method 2a is to remove the Gaussian-shape assumption. The only assumption would be that the $y$ distributions measured from the top and bottom pots are parts (cut by acceptance) of the same distribution. One can flip the $y$ distribution from the bottom pot (blue in \Fg{al el shift test}) and shift it such that it matches to the distribution from the top pot (red). When the best match is found, the position of the beam is given
$${f_B + f_T + s\over 2}\ ,$$
where $f_B$ is the position of the highest bottom pot bin, $f_T$ the lowest top pot bin and $s$ the shift of the blue histogram (left edge) wrt. the red one. Indeed, $s$ can only by a multiple of the bin size. The best match is the one which gives the lowest value of

where $N$ is the number of overlapping bins and $C_{\rm red}(i)$ represents the contents of the bin $i$ of the red histogram.


As measure of uncertainty, one may take a half of the bin size. Of course, this does not reflect systematic errors that may appear because incompatible distributions from the top and bottom RP. An example of this incompatibility can be seen in \Fg{al el plots y shift} left. For the right plot, it is less pronounced, but still present. The differences in shape may come from different acceptances, trigger, detector and reconstruction efficiencies etc. For a fine alignment one would need to correct for all these effects.

The results are summarized in \Tb{al el y shift}. Comparing these to the method 2a (\Tb{al el y full}), one finds differences with RMS of roughly $30\un{\mu m}$, that is well below the estimated uncertainty.

\em{Method 3} is based on \Eq{al el dyy}. The slopes $a$ turn out to be of the order of $20\un{mrad}$ (see \Fg{al el plots dyy}) therefore neglecting the middle term would create an error of $\approx 2\un{\mu m}$, assuming $\De y_n$ is of the order of $100\un{\mu m}$. The $2\un{\mu m}$ are a negligible error compared to the corrections one may get with this method. Thus, we will use
$$b = \De y_F - \De y_N\ .$$
In other words, the intercept gives the relative far-near vertical misalignment.

The fits are performed in a similar manner as in method 1, with the difference that the RMS of distance-to-cut-line distribution is attributed to $\De_{F-N} y$ quantity. An example of the fits is shown if \Fg{al el plots dyy}. Again the one-side fits are compatible with each other and the global fit (with the exception of the red fit in the left-hand side plot). This means that the far-near misalignments are the same for top and bottom pots, a result that is expected after a track-based alignment step.

\Tb{al el dyy} summarizes the results (left part) and provides a comparison to method 2a (right part) -- the $\De y$ results from \Tb{al el y full} were used to predict the intercepts. With the exception of the sector 56 measurement from 5 Oct data, all the differences lie below the estimated error.

\section[al sum]{Summary}

\> tasks accomplished/non-accomplished
\>> TBA left 4 shift and 4 rotation modes unresolved
\>> Elastic/profile methods fixed the 4 shift modes
\>> From Optical alignment there is no indication of U-V rotation.
\>> Once optics is known better, the far-near rotation could be determined from the shift of the elastic peaks.

\> final uncertainty
\>> internal shifts and rotations
\>> inter-RP shifts and rotations
\>> x al. wrt beam
\>> y al. far-near
\>> y al. absolute wrt beam

\> error impact on the physics reconstruction (of elastic $t$)
\>> errors and unresolved modes
