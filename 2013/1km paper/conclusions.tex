\section{Summary and Outlook}

\> conclude the (quite a few) Coulomb-study results
\>> generally summarise the feasibility of the task
\>> summarise the numbers, uncertainties

\> emphasize very first results, original work
\>> first LHC result of si tot where
\>>> rho determined in the same analysis (not from an external source)
\>>> explicit separation of Coulomb and nuclear components

\> emphasize novel methods, used for the first times
\>> RPs extremely close to beam, novel collimation procedure

\> prospects for future
\>> how could things be done better: requirements from theory/experiment
\>>> need better distinction between the hadronic and CNI components
\>>> either from theory: narrow the range of possible parametrisations
\>>> either from experiment: extremely precise data (more statistics, lower $|t|$, ...)
