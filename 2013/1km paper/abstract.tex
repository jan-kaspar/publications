The TOTEM experiment at the CERN LHC has measured elastic proton-proton 
scattering at the centre-of-mass energy 
$\sqrt{s}=8\,$TeV and squared four-momentum transfers $|t|$ from $6\times10^{-4}\,\rm GeV^{2}$ to 0.2\,GeV$^{2}$.
Near the lower end of the $t$-interval, for
$|t| \lesssim 2\times10^{-3}\,\rm GeV^{2}$, the differential cross-section is 
sensitive to the 
interference between the hadronic and the electromagnetic scattering amplitudes.
This article presents the measured cross-section and its interpretation for 
different assumptions on the functional forms of the interference term and of 
the phase of the hadronic elastic amplitude. In 
particular, the $\rho$-parameter, i.e. 
the arctangent of the hadronic phase at $t = 0$,
%the ratio between the real and the 
%imaginary parts of the forward hadronic elastic amplitude, 
was determined for each case. The conditional results for $\rho$ lie in the 
range $0.059 - 0.12$ with a typical uncertainty of $\sim0.02$.
