In a dedicated run at the LHC with a $\beta^*$ of $1000\un{m}$ and consequently a beam divergence of less than $0.8\un{\mu rad}$ TOTEM has taken elastic proton-proton scattering data at a centre-of-mass energy of $8\un{TeV}$. Under these conditions, TOTEM was able to determine the elastic cross-section down to values of the four-momentum transfer squared $|t|\approx 6\cdot 10^{-4}\un{GeV^2}$. Whereas at larger $|t|$ values the scattering is described by nuclear interactions and at lower $|t|$ by the known Coulomb scattering, the now reachable interesting range $|t| \lesssim 10^{-3}\un{GeV^2}$ is sensitive to the Coulomb-nuclear interference that is subject to several models developed during the last decades. The functional forms of the nuclear modulus and the phase are model dependent and hence several general and complex interference formulae are used in the analysis. 
Due to the theoretical impact on (and of) the analysis, TOTEM would appreciate if an editor from theoretical physics could take care of the publication.
