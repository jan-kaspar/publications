\BeginText
In paper \bref{extrapolation} we studied dependency of extrapolation deviation on several parameters. Here, we vary $|t_{min}|$ parameter which was fixed in the referred paper. Values of the other parameters are the best values we have found, see Tabs. 3, 5 and 7 in \bref{extrapolation}.

\bmfig[Extrapolation at $\be^* = 1535\un{m}$ optics with reduced emittance. Black curves represent fits with parameters of variant 1, red 2 and blue 3 from Tabs. 3 and 5 in the cited paper.]
